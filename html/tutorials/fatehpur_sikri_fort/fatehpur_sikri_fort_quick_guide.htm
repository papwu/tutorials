<h1>Fatehpur Sikri Fort - History</h1>
<p>Fatehpur Sikri is near Agra and once was the capital of Mughal Emperor Akbar. The architecture of the city was designed by <b>Tuhir Das</b> and <b>Dhruv Chawla</b>. Akbar founded the city in 1569 after winning <b>Chittor</b> and <b>Ranthambore</b>. The construction of the city was completed in around 15 years and included, palaces, harems, courts, and other structures.</p>
<img src="/fatehpur_sikri_fort/images/akbar.jpg" alt="Akbar" />
<h2>Construction of Buildings</h2>
<p>Akbar was very anxious about its construction and himself looked after it. Persian and Indian architecture were used in the construction of the city. The buildings in the city were built using red sandstone. The pavilions of the imperial palace are geometrically arranged and this design was adopted from Arabian architecture.</p>
<h2>Abandonment of Fatehpur Sikri</h2>
<p>Akbar abandoned the city in 1585 due to shortage of water and frequent wars between Mughals and Rajputs. The capital was shifted to Lahore and in 1598, Akbar made Agra his capital. In 1601, Akbar returned to the city for a short period. Mohammad Shah and Sayyad Hussain Ali Khan Barha also came here for brief period in 1720. Sayyad Husain was the regent of Mohammad Shah.</p>
<p>Marathas captured the city after the conquest of Delhi and later the rule was transferred to British who made the complex as their headquarters. Currently, the mosque inside the complex is in use now. Apart from this and some imperial buildings, most of the city has been ruined. Tourists can find the ruins of the bazaars and naubat khana.</p>
<h1>Fatehpur Sikri Fort - Architecture</h1>
<p>Fatehpur Sikri is surrounded by wall on three sides and a lake on the fourth side. The architecture of the buildings was based on Mughal and Indian architecture. The Indian architecture included the Hindu and Jain architecture.</p>

<h1>Fatehpur Sikri Fort - Places of Worship</h1>
<p>The Jama Masjid, Ibadat Khana, and the Jamat Khana were the three buildings where people during the reign used to worship. Jama Masjid is still used to worship.</p>
<h2>Jama Masjid</h2>
<p>The Jama Masjid was built in 1571AD. Iranian architecture along with Mughal architecture have been used to build the mosque. It is one of the largest mosques in the world which can be entered through Buland Darwaza. The chhaja is very slanting and square chhatris surround the brackets of the chhajja.</p>
<img src="/fatehpur_sikri_fort/images/jama_masjid.jpg" alt="Jama Masjid" />
<p>The mosque has a large courtyard where the people can come and worship in congregation. Around 25,000 people can worship in the mosque at a time. People can enter the mosque through north, south and east sides by using stairs. The tower of the mosque is of five storeys out of which first three storeys and the fifth storey are made up of red sand stone and the fourth is made up of marble.</p>
<h2>Ibadat Khana</h2>
<p>Akbar built the Ibadat Khana in 1575 to hold meetings with the religious leaders of different religions. The participants include Hindu, Jains, Roman Catholics, and Zoroastrians. These discussions were held every Thursday evening. Akbar has the aim of reconciling different religions which included Sufism, Bhakti Movement of Hinduism, and Fire Ceremonies of Zoroastrianism, and Jainism.</p>
<img src="/fatehpur_sikri_fort/images/ibadat_khana.jpg" alt="Ibadat Khana" />
<p>He created a new faith called <b>Din-i-Ilahi</b>. Akbar stopped eating non-veg due to the influence of Jainism. Animal slaughtering was prohibited on <b>Paryushan</b> and <b>Mahavir Jayanti</b>, the festivals of Jains.</p>
<h2>Jamat Khana</h2>
<p>Jamat Khana is situated on the east of <b>Salim Chishti’s tomb</b>. This was the place where Sheikh Salim Chishti used to worship with his disciples. As all other monuments, it was also built with red sandstone. <b>Sheikh Haji Hussain</b> was buried after his death in 1591 so it was made a graveyard and many followers of Sheikh Salim Chishti were buried here. The graves of males can be identified by the verses of the Holy Quran while women graves can be identified by flat bard called <b>takhti</b>.</p>
<img src="/fatehpur_sikri_fort/images/jamat_khana.jpg" alt="Jamat Khana" />
<p>Tourists can reach the courtyard through a magnificent gate. The chamber inside is the tomb of <b>Islam Khan</b>, grandson of Sheikh Salim Chishti. The chamber looks square in shape from outside but octagonal from inside. <b>Yaran Chabutra</b> or <b>friend’s platform</b> also has the graves of the disciples of the saint. Tourists can enter this platform through <b>Badshahi Darwaza</b> situated on the east of the Jamat Khana.</p>
<h1>Fatehpur Sikri Fort - Tombs</h1>
<h2>Tomb of Salim Chishti</h2>
<p>The tomb of Salim Chishti was built during the reign of Akbar between 1580 and 1581. It is a place where Sufi Saint Salim Chishti is buried. Akbar built it in order to respect the saint as the saint prayed for him for having a male son to become his heir.</p>
<p>The platform on which the tomb is constructed has the height of 1m. Tourists can enter the tomb through five steps. The tomb is surrounded by marble screens. The location of the tomb is in the center of the hall having semi-circular dome.</p>
<img src="/fatehpur_sikri_fort/images/tomb.jpg" alt="Tomb" />
<p>The platform is built by using black and yellow marble. A marble cenotaph is surrounded by <b>chhaparkhat</b> which is mostly covered by a green-colored cloth. The door of the main chamber has inscriptions from the Holy Quran. People come here to ask for blessings to fulfil their wishes.</p>
<h2>Zanana Rouza</h2>
<p>The entrance of Zanana Rouza or the women’s tomb lies between Jamat Khana and tomb of Salim Chishti. The entrance is made up of marble and red sandstone. There is a central arch with a square opening and this arch consists of floral design. This tomb was connected by an underground pathway to Sheikh Salim Chishti house during his life time.</p>
<p>The women of the family of Salim Chishti used this path to go to the saint’s house and listen to him. Two chambers are there divided into sections. These sections are divided into subsections having graves of the ladies of the house of Salim Chishti.</p>
<h1>Fatehpur Sikri Fort - Halls</h1>
<p>Diwan-i-Aam and Diwan-i-Khas are the two halls in the complex. Diwan-i-Aam was used to address the local public, hear their complaints, and do judgement while Diwan-i-Khas was to hold meetings with royal people, courtiers, and guests.</p>
<h2>Diwan-i-Aam</h2>
