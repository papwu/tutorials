<h1>SAP QM - Overview</h1>
<p>SAP Quality Management is a part of SAP R/3 system and is integrated with other SAP modules like SAP Material Management (MM), Production Planning (PP), and Plant Maintenance (PM). QM is an integral part of logistic management and it is used to perform quality functions such as quality planning, quality assurance, and quality control, at various stages such as incoming material stage, in-process manufacturing process stage, and after production as well.</p>
<p>With Quality Management module, you can implement the key modules of QM system as defined in manufacturing standards like ISO 9000.</p>
<p>As SAP Quality Management is an integral part of SAP R/3 system, it performs the following key functions in manufacturing of goods &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Quality Planning</b> &minus; Quality planning allows to plan the inspection of goods from the vendor, raw material, work-in-process, and final product.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Quality Notifications</b> &minus; Quality notification includes the defect identification and steps to be taken by quality department.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Quality Inspection</b> &minus; Here, quality results are captured and decision is taken as to whether an inspection lot is to be accepted or rejected.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the following diagram, you can see the key components that are involved in SAP Quality Management process.</p>
<img src="/sap_qm/images/qm_process.jpg" alt="QM Process" />
<h1>SAP QM - Components</h1>
<h2>Quality Planning</h2>
<p>Quality planning includes data for quality planning and how the quality process has to be performed?</p>
<p>You perform Quality inspection plan. It is used to define the way you can inspect an item and the steps involved to perform an inspection. It also determines the characteristics of an item to be inspected and what equipment are required to perform an inspection.</p>
<p>Inspection plan definition is an important part of the QM planning process. The inspection plan contains the number of characteristics of the item to be inspected and the list of tests to be performed for performing the inspection.</p>
<p>Inspection planning can be done for raw material, work in progress and finished products.</p>
<h2>Quality Assurance</h2>
<p>Under Quality assurance, it includes the quality inspection.</p>
<p>A Quality inspection involves someone from the quality department inspecting an item as per the defined points in inspection plan. You perform the inspection based on one or more inspection lots, where a lot is a request to inspect a specific item.</p>
<p>In SAP system, you can create Inspection lot either manually by a user or automatically in the system.</p>
<h2>Quality Control</h2>
<p>Under Quality Control, you have quality notifications, standard reports, and Quality notification system. Quality control determine what actions need to be taken as after defects are detected.</p>
<p>The quality notification process includes recording problem that is either identified by a customer for a product manufactured in an organization, or in a company against the product of a supplier/vendor.</p>
<p>Quality notification can be raised internally to raise an issue that have arisen on the production line. A quality notification can be assigned to an existing order or you can also create a new order as per the quality notification.</p>
<h2>Standard Reports</h2>
<p>You can create reports in QM system to check how many times a product has been identified with a defect and improvement areas that your company has to implement. There are number of reports that can be generated in QM &minus;</p>
<h3>Material Defects Report</h3>
<p>It can be used to check the number of times an item has been identified with a defect status.</p>
<h3>Vendor Defect Report</h3>
<p>This report is used to show the number of defected material supplied by a vendor. This can be checked by examining the inspection lots of the goods received. A quality department can highlight vendors who have supplied material which are failing in inspection.</p>
<h3>Customer Defect Report</h3>
<p>This report is used to show the defects that were found on inspections for outbound deliveries. This helps the organization to improve the quality of goods delivered and hence raise the customer satisfaction.</p>

<h1>SAP QM - Benefits</h1>
<p>Using SAP QM process, you can achieve the following benefits &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>SAP Quality Management integration with other modules is one of the key aspect of quality management. You can implement the quality process in Material Management, Production Planning and other SAP modules.</p></li>
<li><p>You can access the data maintained in the system related to customer, vendor and supplier master.</p></li>
<li><p>Using SAP QM, a standardized process can be implemented.</p></li>
<li><p>SAP Quality Management process helps you to incorporate the improvement process- by monitoring the processes, defect identification and quality notifications.</p></li>
<li><p>You can perform automation of information flow by which inspection lot is created automatically when you release the production order or goods receipt.</p></li>
<li><p>Using SAP Quality Management process, you can perform the quality compliance of raw materials when it is first delivered by vendors/suppliers and in process manufacturing and also after the production process is completed.</p></li>
<li><p>SAP QM is also responsible to perform compliance with a customer’s quality specifications; you ship the goods to customer as per the Purchase order.</p></li>
<li><p>In SAP MM process, SAP QM allows a company's representative to visit the supplier office to check the quality of the goods they produce. You call this process as source inspection in Quality Management module.</p></li>
