<h1>Synchronized Swimming - Overview</h1>
<p>Synchronized swimming is a game where a group of athletes perform dance steps in combination with swimming. The dance is performed according to the tune played in background. This tutorial explains the basics of synchronized swimming and how to become a professional synchronised swimmer.</p>
<p>Like other events in swimming, players can perform solos, duets, combos or team. There are two routines in synchronized swimming &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Technical routine</b> &minus; In technical routine, the players perform according to a set of predetermined steps. It should be performed strictly according to certain guidelines.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Free routine</b> &minus; Here, the steps are not predetermined, so the players are free to choose their own steps. In free routine, the players have to show their creativity in choreography, dancing, and coordination.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>A Little History of Synchronized Swimming</h2>
<p>Synchronised swimming was very famous before it was included in Olympics. For the first time, it was played in 1891 as recorded in history. At that time, it was played in Berlin, Germany. After seeing the event, many countries became interested in playing this sport and many clubs were formed. Simultaneously, this sport became popular in US and Canada.</p>
<p>For the first time, synchronised swimming was included in Los Angeles Olympics in 1984.  Between 1984 and 1992, it was played with two events <b>solo</b> and <b>duet</b>. In 1996 Atlanta Olympics, only team event was included. But from 2000 Olympics held in Sydney, two events i.e. duet and team events were held and now synchronised swimming has become a crowd pulling sport.</p>
<h2>Participating Countries</h2>
<p>Since its inception, the game became very famous in many Asian and Non-Asian countries. Performers from different countries perform every year in world aquatic championships. Recent world championship (2015) was held at Kazan, Russia.</p>
<p>The following countries have dominated the sport in case of medals.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>United States</li> 
<li>China</li> 
<li>Russia</li> 
<li>Australia</li> 
<li>East Germany</li>
</ul>
<h1>Synchronized Swimming - Equipment</h1>
<p>Synchronised swimming is a form of rhythmic swimming where the athletes have to respond according to the music and have to swim or dance in water accordingly. Hence, the equipment used in this sport are quite different from other swimming sports.</p>
<p>Before moving on to the equipment used by the athletes, let us first get to know about the playing environment where synchronized swimming is performed.</p>
<h2>Playing Environment</h2>
<p>Synchronized swimming is played in a specially designed pool. The water in the pool must be clean and the temperature of the water must be around 25 degree Celsius. The size of the pool must be a minimum of 20m by 30m, and within that a 12m by 12m area must be at least 3 m deep.</p>
<p>Let us now discuss the equipment used in synchronized swimming.</p>
<h2>Nose clip</h2>
<img class="raligned" src="/synchronized_swimming/images/nose_clip.jpg" alt="Nose Clip" /> 
<p>In synchronized swimming, the athletes have to perform a lot of underwater movements. There are chances of water entering into the nose of the players. In order to avoid that, the athletes use a small clip of hard plastic or wire. It also has a thin rubber coating.</p>
<h2>Goggles</h2>
<img class="raligned" src="/synchronized_swimming/images/goggles.jpg" alt="Goggles" />
<p>Goggles provide safety to the eyes. Due to underwater movement, water may enter in the eyes. It is important to note that the goggles are not allowed for routine competitions.</p>
<p>Athletes can use goggles only for trainings. This is only used for figure test. Like goggles, athletes also cannot use the bathing caps during routine competitions. During figure test, only a white or black bathing cap is worn by athletes.</p>
<h2>Underwater Speakers</h2>
<img class="raligned" src="/synchronized_swimming/images/underwater_speaker.jpg" alt="Underwater Speaker" /> 
<p>The most important equipment for synchronized swimming is the underwater speakers. Swimmers cannot perform under water if the music is not audible. Music plays an important role in synchronized swimming because it is a rhythmic sport.</p>
<p>We know that impedance of water is 3600 times more than that of air. There is also a 62 dB (decibel) offset between the sound that travels in air and that in water. To overcome this problem, the underwater speakers used in synchronized swimming depend on <b>Piezoelectric Technology</b>.</p>
<h2>Swimsuit</h2>
<img class="raligned" src="/synchronized_swimming/images/swimsuit.jpg" alt="Swimsuit" /> 
<p>One of the most important aspects of the swimsuit is that it must be comfortable for the athletes and it must be non-transparent. During the figure test, a black swimsuit is recommended for the athletes and during routine competition, a routine suit for each athlete that suits the music is recommended.</p>
<p>It may also happen that athletes perform in two events like duet and team event. In such a situation, the athletes will be provided with two different swimsuits.</p>
<h1>How to Play Synchronized Swimming?</h1>
<p>In earlier days, synchronised swimming was known as <b>Water Ballet</b>. History says that the first recorded international competition was held in Berlin, Germany in 1891. After that event, many countries shown interest and clubs from respective countries were formed to play and organise competitive matches. Some of the skills performed in this sport are as follows &minus;</p>
<h2>Eggbeater</h2>
<p>All the synchronised swimmers must have a clear idea about the eggbeater skill. It is one of the most fundamental skills in this sport. In this skill, a swimmer can attain stability and reach to a height above the water. Then she can leave the hands free to perform other acts. An athlete can reach as much height as possible but the average height is around chest level.</p>
<p>Though, this is a sport, but it is choreographed because of music and dance. By eggbeater, the athlete comes above the water level and is upright. At the same time, she has to put either both of her arms or at least a single arm in the air.  It does not end with this. If a swimmer wants to go up vertically in the air above the water, there is boost technique. This is performed by an eggbeater build-up followed by a strong team effort by legs to propel the swimmer out of the water vertically.</p>
<img src="/synchronized_swimming/images/eggbeater.jpg" alt="Eggbeater" />
<h2>Sculls</h2>
<p>Eggbeater skill is normally performed by legs but, on the contrary, sculls mainly depend on hands. The hands of the other supporting athletes are used to propel the body of an athlete. There are different types of sculls used in synchronised swimming.</p>
<img src="/synchronized_swimming/images/sculls.jpg" alt="Sculls" />
<p>The famous and most used scull techniques are <b>support scull, torpedo scull</b>, and <b>propeller scull</b>.</p>
<p>The other techniques which are also widely performed are <b>stationary scull, alligator scull, paddle scull, barrel scull</b>, and <b>split arm scull</b>.</p>
<p>There are also other sculls like <b>reverse scull</b> and <b>direct propeller</b> which are used in training.</p>
<h2>Positions</h2>
<p>In synchronized swimming, there are a number of positions which will not allow you to blink your eyes. These are very famous and overall look very charming and graceful when athletes perform.</p>
<img src="/synchronized_swimming/images/positions.jpg" alt="Positions" />
<p>Following are some of the positions &minus;</p>
<p><b>Tub</b> &minus; In this position, both of the legs are raised up to the chest. The shins and top of the feet should be parallel to the water.</p>
<p><b>Split Position</b> &minus; One of the legs of the swimmer is extended back and one is stretched forward along the surface but the swimmer has to be in vertical position.</p>
<p><b>Knight</b> &minus; Here the legs are flat on the surface of water and to make a knight’s posture the head is vertically in line with the hips. At the same time, the body is arched on the surface.</p>
<p><b>Heron or Bent Knee</b> &minus; Here also the body will be in a vertical position and, as the name suggests, one leg will be bent and the other one will be straight.</p>
<p><b>Crane</b> &minus; Here the body of the swimmer should be in vertical position and being in this position, one leg should be in vertical position and other should be parallel to the surface.</p>
<p><b>Side Fishtail</b> &minus; This is similar like a crane position but a side Y posture is additional in this position.</p>
<p><b>Back Layout</b> &minus; This a normal basic swimming position where a swimmer lies and swims on surface looking up and sculling under her hips.</p>
<p><b>Front Layout</b> &minus; In this position, the swimmer’s face will be under the surface and the back is up. The swimmer has to perform sculling by her chest and no breathing shall be done.</p>
<p><b>Flamingo</b> &minus; In this position, the bottom leg has to be pulled up to the chest in such a way that its shin touches the knee of the vertical leg.</p>
<p><b>Ballet Leg</b> &minus; Here one leg is extended and held perpendicular to the body and the other one is parallel to the surface.</p>
<h1>Synchronized Swimming - Rules</h1>
