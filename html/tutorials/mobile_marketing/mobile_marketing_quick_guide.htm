<img src="/mobile_marketing/images/technology_and_reach.jpg" alt="Technology and Reach" />
<h1>Mobile Marketing - Strategies</h1>
<p>People use their mobile phones to not only remain in contact, but also for reading the review of the products, knowing about the new products in the market, and of course online purchasing. In such a condition, developing a masterly designed mobile marketing strategy is significant for your business.</p>
<h2>What is Mobile Marketing Strategy?</h2>
<p>Before you begin developing a mobile marketing strategy, you should figure out how it will fit with your other marketing plans. It will help you to find out what is important to your business. Is product branding a current goal? Or is customer acquisition and lead generation a priority task? Maybe it’s none of these and more about social media engagement and viral marketing. Whatever it is, you have to synergize your marketing strategy with the current priorities of your company.</p>
<img src="/mobile_marketing/images/mobile_marketing_strategy.jpg" alt="Mobile Marketing Strategy" />
<p>That being said, let’s look at how you can go about developing a mobile marketing strategy.</p>
<h2>Research for Information</h2>
<p>Market research related to your business is the first step. Here are some tips on what kinds of research you should be doing &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Research how mobile marketing is done in your industry, you can join online forums or partner with someone;</p></li>
<li><p>Gather data relevant to your product or service such as case studies, research analysis reports, whitepapers, etc.; and</p></li>
<li><p>Do a comparative analysis by surfing their websites, press releases, online campaign, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Identify Your Target Audience</h2>
<p>Identifying your target audience and their choices will help you to take better decisions and develop successful marketing campaign. Following are the three important steps that you need to follow while identifying your target audience &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Make a detailed list of potential customers and give them actual names and identities;</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct online surveys, emails of customers etc. to understand what questions they have;</p></li>
<li><p>Create customer personas by visualizing specific attributes such as their age, profession, task they perform etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Define the Value of Your Offerings</h2>
<p>One of the most significant steps before designing a mobile campaign is to have the answers ready for the following questions &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>How is your product/service beneficial to your customers?</li>
<li>What are the additional benefits you are offering in comparison to your competitors?</li>
<li>How is it going to fulfill their needs?</li>
<li>How will it fit their budget?</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding the value or <b>unique selling proposition</b> (USP) of your product or service helps you to engage your customers better right from the time you first communicate with them to the time they become repeat customers. Once you define the value offering in your marketing strategy, the task of making new customers and maintaining the existing ones become much easier.</p>
<h2>Outline Your Goals &amp; Objectives</h2>
<p>What you want to achieve with your marketing efforts is one of the most important questions. It determines the budget you allocate towards marketing and the channels you choose to market your product and services. You have to define it clearly what you want to accomplish. Is it more sales? Or is it more brand awareness? The outlining of your goals and objectives is the cornerstone of your marketing strategy.</p>
<h1>Mobile Marketing - Policies</h1>
<p>For smooth running of your mobile marketing campaign, you need to define well-accepted policies and then strategize your campaign based on the defined policies.</p>
<h2>What is Mobile Marketing Policy?</h2>
<p>Mobile Marketing policy is – maintaining the consumer privacy standards, which is necessary for the smooth running of a marketing campaign. It is done by guarding mobile users from undesirable communications on their mobile phones.</p>
<p>First thing to make sure is negating ‘Spamming.’ Mobile content should be as original and unique as desktop content and your mobile marketing campaign should always be on board. To ensure the rewards, use right policy and channels for marketing.</p>

<img src="/mobile_marketing/images/sms_campaign_techniques.jpg" alt="SMS Campaign Techniques" />
<h3>Creating a User Flow Diagram</h3>
<p>A user flow diagram is a tool created either in Microsoft Word or Microsoft PowerPoint. It documents the entire interactions of a user with your marketing program. For instance, if a subscriber replied to a call to action in your message, all these can be documented and you can show it through a user-flow diagram.</p>
<h3>Carrier Approval Certification</h3>
<p>In every country, the messages that a business sends out to customers must be pre-approved by an agency. You need to submit a number of information about your business such as your contact, common short code owner, campaign, and billing details to your carrier. Once you have done this, you can start your campaign.</p>
<h3>Common Short Codes</h3>

<p>Customers acquisition = budget &divide; COCA</p>
<p>Hence, $200,000 &divide; 100 = 2,000</p>
<p>Therefore, new customers = 2,000</p>
<p>Direct response (of new customers) = 2,000</p>
