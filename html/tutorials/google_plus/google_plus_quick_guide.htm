<h1>Google Plus - Introduction</h1>
<p>Google+ (Google Plus) is an interest-based social networking site owned by Google Inc. Launched in 2011, this platform brings together people with similar interest. Such group of people can build a community and share their ideas through photos and posts.</p>  
<p>Google+ is unique in way in that it allows more transparency in what one shares and with whom it is shared. The Google+ menu bar is displayed on other Google services when one logs in the google account.</p>
<img src="/google_plus/images/google_plus.jpg" alt="Google Plus" />
<p>Some of the most prominent features of Google+ are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Posts</b> where one can update the status. </p></li>
<li><p><b>Circles</b> are used to share information with different groups.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Sparks</b> offer videos that users might like.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Hangouts &amp; Huddles</b> are for video chat with a friend or a group of friends.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Google+ Versus Other Platforms</h2>
<p>Google+ offers rich features like Hangouts, Google Events, Google Communities, Google Circles, etc. Other social platforms are standalone networking platforms. Google+ is integrated with all Google products and services.</p>  
<p>Google+ helps to boost our SERP ranking, which is not possible with Facebook, Twitter, etc. Whatever we post on Google+ gets indexed in a short span of time enhancing the real-time search. Google+ uses rich snippets to optimize results. This enhances the credibility points for every activity on Google+.</p>
<h2>Google+ Personal Page</h2>
<p>Google+ personal profile page is where we can upload our pictures. A personal profile page provides the flexibility to engage with people. The profile should be actual with accurate name and pictures which are easily accessible. The default is personal and everything we post is private. Google+ personal page represents an individual and we can manage it as an individual. Basically, the person who creates the profile can manage it. Members of the circle can only like or comment on our posts and photos.</p>
<img src="/google_plus/images/dunk_instyle.jpg" alt="Dunk instyle" />
<h2>Business Profile Page</h2>
<p>Google+ business page is similar to Facebook business page where our posts and uploaded pictures is visible to the users who like our page. We can comment or interact with people who comment on our business page. More than one person can use/manage the page unlike the personal profile page, where only the one has the right to maintain it.</p>
<img src="/google_plus/images/see_photos.jpg" alt="See Photos" />
<p>In this case, the default is public where anyone can like or comment on our page. Google+ page represents a business, brand, etc. hence we can name the page accordingly.  Google+ business page has a feature ‘customer reviews’ which is not on personal profile page. It is a very efficient way to attract more users. Customer reviews makes the page look trustworthy to new users. The page also contains insights which shows how many people are engaging or viewing the page.</p>
<h1>Google Plus - Business Page Setting</h1>
<p>Google+ has over 300 million active users. Hence, it can be used for business purpose to reach millions of customers worldwide. The Google+ platform is managed through a dashboard ‘<b>Google My Business</b>’. It uses maps, search, and Google+ to make it easy for our brand to be more visible on search. It allows users to share their experiences in the form of reviews. We can use these reviews to get more credibility, improve our search rank and influence the buyers. To set up a business page, first we have to create an account.</p>
<p>Visit <b>business.google.com</b> or <b>Google My Business locations</b>. In case there are many businesses in different places, we have to set up an account for all of them individually. Click the hamburger <b>☰</b> icon on the top left corner of the page.</p>
<p>Click the Create business account. Enter the business type, it offers three options to choose from &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Storefront</b> &minus; Choose this option if the customers are to visit our business place. In the search results, Google+ will show the location, the duration and other contact information like phone number, address, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Service area</b> &minus; Choose this option if the customers are to be served at their place. In the search results, Google+ will show location, duration, and other contact information, such as phone number, address, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Brand</b> &minus; In search results, Google+ will not show the location, duration, and other contact information.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/google_plus/images/business_type.jpg" alt="Business Type" />
<p>Service area and Storefront are options for local businesses, and brand is for the product type. From option 1 and 2, if we select one of them then we’ll be prompted to select the business name and the location.</p>
<p>Add the business info. Make the business profile look decent and appealing to others by adding photos of the brand and also by creating a URL which provides a recognizable web address of the brand.</p>
<p>We can also connect the business page to the existing pages by selecting a location. Click Manage this location. Click the hamburger icon on the top left hand side of the page. Select settings and then click Connect a different page. Choose the Google+ page that is to be connected to the business account page from the dropdown menu and click Done. An account will be created. We can rename or delete the business account any time we feel like.</p>
<h1>Google Plus - Creating a New Account</h1>
<p>Following are the steps to create a new account.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Create a Gmail account. It is always advisable not to use the existing account if we are creating an account for business purposes. Create a new account and allow only business team members to your circles.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Open <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://plus.google.com/collections/featured">https://plus.google.com/</a></p></li>
<li><p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Click the hamburger icon ☰ situated on the top left side of the page that pops up.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Open the option ‘Join Google+’.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; Create a public profile by adding name, DoB, gender, etc. and click Upgrade.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Step 6</b> &minus; Search for people that we want to add to the page and click Continue.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Step 7</b> &minus; Follow things of interest such as entertainment, news, fashion, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Step 8</b> &minus; Put a face to the name, mention the place of work, and educational qualifications. Click ‘Finish’ once done filling all these details.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Step 9</b> &minus; Build circles and communities.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Step 10</b> &minus; Post contents, profile and cover pictures.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Navigating Through Google Plus</h1>
<p>When we land on Google+ page, we will come across a left sidebar.</p>
<img src="/google_plus/images/navigation.jpg" alt="Navigation" />
<p>Following are the tabs on the sidebar.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Home</b> tab is the timeline comprising the posts shared by others.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Collections</b> tab is where we can collect different posts under different attributes. This is helpful for self as well as others to easily find what they want to see.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Communities</b> tab refers to groups of different people who share the same interest as ours. We can join a community to see what is going on in people’s life, share our ideas, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Profile</b> tab is the intro page. This is where we can write a short description of our page or business. Users can view our interest boards and posts.</p></li>
<li><p><b>People</b> tab is where we can see our followers and who we are following. This is where we receive some suggestion from the application as to who could be our interest or pal.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Notification</b> tab is where we will be notified of all the activities taking place in our account.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Setting</b> tab is an important tab. Using this tab, we can set our account as we wish to. We can edit people activities related to our account such as who can send notifications and comment on our posts, who can view our activities. We can even decide the privacy of our photos and videos. Edit how our profile looks to people and restrict our stream layout. We can even share our location if we desire.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Feedback</b> button, as the name suggests, allows us to send feedback.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Help</b> section supports us with issues we are having difficulty with.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Google Plus - Adding Business Details</h1>
<p>To add business details to Google+ page, we need to have access to My Business section. <b>Google My Business</b> is a platform which makes it easy to find and connect with  customers. It uses search, maps, etc. to make the brand visible to search results.</p>

<h3>Engagement</h3>
<p>It shows the number of +1’s, shares and comments a page got over the month. This Google+ insight helps managers calculate the metrics about each post. For the first 72 hours, the statistical data displays after a gap of an hour.</p>  
<p>We can even review which photo or video of ours was the most engaging, how many people are sharing our content. The recent posts section gives an idea on the number of views on the post along with analytics on the number of likes and comments on our post.</p> 
<h3>Audience</h3> 
<p>This special insight reports the growth of followers for our posts, pictures, or page. Information about the followers, whether they are outside our country can also be obtained.</p>
<p>With the help of gender and age graph, we can calculate gender and age percentage. Hence, the age group of followers can be easily calculated.</p>

<h1>Google Plus - Connecting With YouTube</h1>
<p>Google owns the YouTube platform, which is the largest video service provider. We can create a Google+ page through YouTube. Our channel will be connected to Google+ page. Our public videos will appear both on YouTube and Google+ page. This helps in engaging more number of people.</p>  
<p>There can be multiple users managing one account on YouTube. If we  want to use a different name from Google account, connect it to Google+ account. Viewers can't see our name or address as there will be no public association between Google+ and Google account. We can do this to enhance our business on YouTube without showing our personal account. When we connect our channel with Google+ page, it will show the same name as our channel on YouTube.</p> 
<p>It’s easy to switch the two accounts on YouTube to manage YouTube channel. We can simply change this from the top right corner of YouTube account by choosing the account from our list.</p>
<h2>YouTube Integration</h2>
<p>On opening YouTube channel, Google+ account is connected to it and displays the Google+ profile picture. We can use Google+ to upload videos on YouTube.</p> 
<p>When we write a comment on YouTube, our Google+ profile and id shows to the other users. Moreover, when we change the name or display picture, it gets changed both on YouTube and Google+ pages.</p>
<h2>Creating an Account to Connect YouTube with Google+</h2>
<p>Open the YouTube app and try liking and commenting on the videos. We cannot do this as we are not connected to it using the Google account.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Go to ‘Account settings’.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Click ‘Advanced account settings’ and then click ‘Connect with a Google+ page’.</p>

<h1>Google Plus - Social Linking</h1>
<p>Google+ allows us to connect our Google+ account with other social networks. Without permission, Google won't share our personal things.

<p>This linking primarily affects the SEO and also increases the traffic to our website/page. We can link our Google+ account to any social platform so that people active on other platform can reach our page through these links.</p>
