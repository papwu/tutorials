<h1>Akbar’s Tomb - History</h1>
<p>Akbar was the son of <b>Humayun</b> and grandson of <b>Babur</b>. The tenure of his reign was from 1556 to 1605. Humayun died when Akbar was 13 years old and so he started reigning under the guidance of <b>Bairam Khan</b>. Akbar conquered a large part of India, Pakistan and Afghanistan and in order to control his kingdom, he appointed many governors over his territories.</p>
<h2>Birth of Akbar</h2>
<p>Akbar was born when his Father Humayun left Delhi due to defeat in the <b>battle of Chausa</b> and <b>Kannauj</b>. In both the battles Humayun was defeated by <b>Sher Shah Suri</b>. Humayun was married to a 14-year old girl named <b>Hamida Banu Begum</b> and she gave birth to Akbar in 1542 at <b>Umerkot</b>, a Rajput fort. At that time <b>Rana Prasad</b> provided refuge to Humayun.</p>
<img src="/akbars_tomb/images/humayun.jpg" alt="Humayun" />
<h2>Akbar’s Childhood</h2>
<p>Akbar was nurtured by his uncles <b>Kamran Mirza</b> and <b>Askari Mirza</b>. He learnt to hunt and fight but never read or written. Akbar married to the daughter of his paternal uncle <b>Hindal Mirza</b> whose name was <b>Ruqaiya Sultan Begum</b>. Humayun conquered Delhi in 1555 and again established Mughal Empire.</p>
<h2>Akbar’s Succession</h2>
<p>Humayun died when he fall from stairs in his library and Akbar succeeded him. Akbar was a minor so Bairam Khan guided him in ruling the kingdom. Humayun conquered Delhi, Agra, and Punjab but Suris again reconquered them after his death. Bairam Khan planned an attack on <b>Sikandar Suri</b> but Suri avoided the battle.</p>
<img src="/akbars_tomb/images/akbars.jpg" alt="Akbars" />
<p>His minister <b>Hemu</b> and the army of Suris was defeated in 1556 in the second battle of Panipat. Later Akbar defeated Sikandar Suri and also captured Gwalior which was also under Suris. Akbar expanded his kingdom by defeating many Muslim rulers, Rajput rulers and other rulers. Akbar died in 1605 due to suffering from dysentery.</p>
<h2>Akbar’s love of architecture</h2>
<p>Akbar built many monuments in Delhi and Agra. Some were built for protection, like Agra Fort, and some were built due to his love of architecture like Fatehpur Sikri, Buland Darwaza, Humayun’s Tomb, Jodhabai Palace, and Akbar’s Tomb. Akbar constructed his tomb during his life time. Most of the portion of the tomb was constructed in his reign and the topmost part was constructed by <b>Jahangir</b>.</p>
<h1>Akbar’s Tomb - Architecture</h1>
<p>Akbar built many monuments in his life time mainly in Delhi and Agra. Besides this he also built a city called Fatehpur Sikri which he later abandoned due to scarcity of water. Akbar built forts, palaces and his tomb. The construction of tomb is based on Hindu, Islamic, Buddhist, and Jain rchitecture. The tomb has domes, balconies, windows with jalis and other structures which depicts Hindu architecture.</p>
<h2>Design of Akbar’s Tomb</h2>
<p>Akbar’s tomb is a five storey monument which is built in the shape of a pyramid. The main mausoleum was built in the shape of a square. Tourists can enter the tomb through a huge gate which is similar to the <b>Buland Darwaza</b> in <b>Fatehpur Sikri</b>. There is a garden at the entrance which is divided into four portions.</p>
<h2>Garden</h2>
<p>The tomb is situated in the middle of the garden which is divided into four parts. The garden is surrounded by walls on all sides and there is a main gateway through which people can enter the tomb. Each part of the garden has a water channel and has a terrace. There are also footpaths on the side of each quarter.</p>
<img src="/akbars_tomb/images/garden.jpg" alt="Garden" />
<h2>Minarets</h2>
<p>There are four minarets built on the southern gate and Akbar got this idea from the char minar when he came to Deccan in 1599. There are three storeys in each minaret which are built with marble.</p>
<img src="/akbars_tomb/images/minarets.jpg" alt="Minarets" />
<h2>Gateways</h2>
<p>There are four gateways in the tomb but now only southern gate is used to enter. The rest three are built only for decoration and were not used as gateway. This gate was built by using red sandstone and many designs were inlaid using marble.</p>
<p>The roof of the gateway has four kiosks. The magnificence of the gateway is inspired by the Buland Darwaza which was constructed in Fatehpur Sikri. The gateways are raised at a good height from the garden and staircases are there to approach the gateways.</p>
<h2>First Floor or Ground Floor</h2>
<p>The first floor has cloisters on four sides having arches. There is a hall which has many carvings, paintings and other geometrical structures. The tombstone of Akbar lies in this hall and along with this the tombstones of <b>Shakrul Nisha</b> and <b>Aram Bano</b> is also there. These two ladies were the daughters of Akbar.</p>
<img src="/akbars_tomb/images/tombstone.jpg" alt="Tombstone" />
<h2>Second Floor</h2>
<p>The second floor is in the form of a square and is smaller than the first floor. It has a chhatri of eight pillars supported by eight octagonal pillars on each corner. The diameter of each chhatri is 5.18m. There are 23 bays on each arched verandah situated on each side. Third floor is also supported by these bays.</p>
<h2>Third Floor</h2>
<p>The third floor is smaller than the second floor and is in a form of square and each side measures 31.62m. There are four chhatris, one on each side having the same dimensions as that of the second floor. The cupolas of the chhatris have blue, green, and yellow tiles. The edges of the floor have railings in which jalis are fixed. The jalis have various geometrical designs like star, swastika, triangular and many others.</p>
<h2>Fourth Floor</h2>
<p>The fourth floor is square in shape whose one side measures 27.16m. This floor is smaller than the third floor and has arches with pillar support and chhatris on each side. There is one secret storey on this floor where people can go only through a ladder and enter through a narrow opening. In the secret storey, there are five corridors from east to west and five from north to south which cut each other at right angles. Brick masonry is used to make the tombstone which is at the center.</p>
<h2>Fifth Floor</h2>
<p>Fifth floor is the smallest and is built by using marble. The side of the square-shaped central court has the dimensions of 21.34m. There are dalans or cloisters on all the four sides of the floor. Each dalan measures 27.16 x 2.74m.</p>
