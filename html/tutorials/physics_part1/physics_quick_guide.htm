<h1>Physics - Force and Pressure</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>When an object is either pushed or a pulled is known as a force.</p></li>
<li><p>Motion, generated in an object, is because of an action of a force.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/force.jpg" alt="Force" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The applied force makes the table move in a given direction.</p></li>
<li><p>The strength of a force is commonly expressed by the magnitude.</p></li>
<li><p>Force also has direction; likewise, if the magnitude or direction changes, it directly affects the force.</p></li>
<li><p>If the force is applied in the direction opposite to the direction of motion, then it results in a decrease in the speed of the object.</p></li>
<li><p>If an object is in motion, then external force may change in the state or direction of motion of that object.</p></li>
<li><p>The state of motion of an object is explained by its speed and the direction of motion.</p></li>
<li><p>The state of <b>‘rest’</b> of an object is considered to be the zero speed, as &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>An object cannot move by itself.</p></li>
<li><p>An object cannot change its speed by itself.</p></li>
<li><p>An object cannot change its direction by itself.</p></li>
<li><p>An object cannot change by itself.</p></li>
<li><p>A force may make an object move from rest.</p></li>
<li><p>A force may change the speed of a moving object.</p></li>
<li><p>A force may change the direction of a moving object.</p></li>
<li><p>A force may change the shape of an object.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The force caused by the action of muscles is known as the <b>muscular force</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Some force, decreases the speed of a moving object, is known as ‘<b>friction</b>.’ E.g. moving wheel on road; once the source of force stops working, then wheel stops because of friction.</p></li>
<li><p>The force applied by a charged body on another charged or uncharged body is known as ‘<b>electrostatic force</b>.’</p></li>
<li><p>Objects or things that fall towards the earth, as earth pulls it towards itself; this force is known as the <b>force of gravity</b> or <b>gravity</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The force of gravity is applicable on all objects. In fact, every object in this universe, irrespective of its size and shape, exerts some force on every other object. It happens only because of the ‘<b>gravitational force</b>.’</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Pressure</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The force, applied on a unit area of a surface is known as <b>pressure</b> (Pressure = force/area on which it acts).</p></li>
<li><p>If the area is smaller, then the pressure on a surface would be greater; e.g. this is the reason that the area of one end of a nail is pointed (to exert sufficient pressure) and other end is bigger (as shown in the image given below).</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/pressure.jpg" alt="Pressure" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>This envelop of air is known as the <b>atmosphere</b> that extends up to many kilometers above the surface of the earth.</p></li>
<li><p>The pressure exerted by the air is known as <b>atmospheric pressure</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The pressure inside our bodies is exactly equal to the atmospheric pressure and annuls the pressure acting from outside (see the image given below).</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/atmospheric_pressure.jpg" alt="Atmospheric Pressure" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Liquids and gases also exert pressure on the walls of their respective containers.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Physics - Friction</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p><b>Friction</b> is result of the irregularities on the two surfaces in contact of each other.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/friction.jpg" alt="Friction" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The force of friction is dependent on the irregularities of the surface; if it is greater, then the friction will be greater and if it is smooth, then the friction will be lesser.</p></li>
<li><p>Effectively, the friction is result of the <b>interlocking</b> of irregularities in the two surfaces.</p></li>
<li><p>If the two surfaces (in contact) are pressed harder, then the force of friction will increase.</p></li>
<li><p>On a frictionless surface, if an object starts moving, it would not stop ever; Without friction, it is not possible to construct a building.</p></li>
<li><p>Friction produces heat; when a matchstick is rubbed against the rough surface, it catches fire.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/matchstick.jpg" alt="Matchstick" />
<h2>Substances Reducing Friction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The substances that reduce friction are known as <b>lubricants</b>. E.g. when oil, grease, or graphite is applied between the moving part of a machine, then it creates a thin layer; resultantly, moving surfaces do not directly rub against each other that ultimately reduces friction.</p></li>
<li><p>When a body rolls over the surface of another body, the resistance to its motion is known as the <b>rolling friction</b>. The rolling reduces the force of friction.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/rolling_friction.jpg" alt="Rolling Friction" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The frictional force exerted by fluids is known as <b>drag</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The frictional force, on an object in a fluid, is dependent on its speed with respect to the fluid.</p></li>
<li><p>The frictional force depends on the shape of the respective object and also on the nature of the fluid.</p></li>
<li><p>Fluid friction is minimized by giving suitable shapes to the bodies moving in fluids.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Physics - Some Natural Phenomena</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Lightening, cyclone, earthquake, etc. are the natural phenomena.</p></li>
<li><p>Benjamin Franklin, an American scientist, showed that the lightning and the spark from clothes are essentially the same phenomena.</p></li>
<li><p>When a plastic comb is rubbed with dry hair, it acquires some charge and the object is known as <b>charged</b> objects.</p></li>
<li><p>When charges move, they constitute an electric current.</p></li>
<li><p>Some natural phenomena can cause large scale destruction of human life and property. </p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Lightning</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The process of transferring of charge from a charged object to the earth is known as earthing.</p></li>
<li><p>When negative and positive charges meet, it produces streaks of bright light and sound and the process is known as an <b>electric discharge</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The process of electric discharge also occurs between two or more clouds, or between clouds and the earth (as shown in the image given below).</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/lightning.jpg" alt="Lightning" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>During the lightning and the thunderstorm no open place is safe.</p></li>
<li><p>Electrical appliances such as computers, TVs, etc., should be unplugged; however, electrical lights can be left on, as they do not cause any harm.</p></li>
<li><p>The device, used to protect buildings from the effect of lightning, is known as <b>Lightning Conductor</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>A metallic rod, taller than the building, is fixed in the walls of the building from top to toes during its construction protects from thunderstorm (as shown in the image given below).</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/lightning_conductor.jpg" alt="Lightning Conductor" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The metal columns used during the fixing of electrical wires and water pipes in the buildings also protect from the thunderstorm and lightning.</p></li>
<li><p>If a thunderstorm occurs there is also a possibility of lightning and cyclones.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Earthquakes</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>An earthquake is a sudden shaking or trembling of some region of the earth for a very short time.</p></li>
<li><p>An earthquake is normally caused by a disturbance originated inside the earth’s crust.</p></li>
<li><p>Earthquakes keep occurring almost all the time, all over the earth, but most of them are not even noticeable.</p></li>
<li><p>The major earthquakes are rare, but very much destructive.</p></li>
<li><p>The last major earthquake occurred in India on 8<sup>th</sup> October 2005 in Uri and Tangdhar towns of North Kashmir and before that a major earthquake occurred on 26<sup>th</sup> January 2001 in Bhuj, Gujarat.</p></li>
<li><p>The earthquakes mostly are caused by the movement of earth’s plates (as shown in the image below).</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/earthquakes.jpg" alt="Earthquakes" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Earthquakes are also caused by volcanic eruption/activity, when a meteor hits the earth, or an underground nuclear explosion.</p></li>
<li><p>The power of an earthquake is expressed in terms of a magnitude and measured on a scale known as <b>Richter scale</b> (as shown in the image given below).</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/richter_scale.jpg" alt="Richter scale" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The earthquake, which magnitude is higher than 7 on the Richter scale, is highly destructive.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Physics - Motion</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h1>Physics - Force and Laws of Motion</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>If we apply a force on an object, it may change its position or/and shape as well (as shown in the image given below).</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/object.jpg" alt="Object" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton explained a different approach to understand motion and applied force.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>First Law of Motion</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>According to Galileo an object moves with a constant speed when no force acts on them.</p></li>
<li><p>According to Newton’s First Law of Motion, “<i>an object remains in a state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change that state by an applied force</i>.”</p></li>
<li><p>The tendency of uninterrupted objects to stay at rest or to keep moving (if in motion) with the same velocity is known as <b>inertia</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Newton’s first law of motion is also popular as the <b>law of inertia</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/law_of_inertia.jpg" alt="Law of inertia" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>As shown in the image given above, when the playing card is flicked by the finger, the coin placed on it falls in the glass; it explains the law of inertia.</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore, inertia is a natural tendency of any object to resist a change in its state of motion or of rest.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/newton.jpg" alt="Newton" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Quantitatively, the inertia of an object is measured by its mass, as the heavier or bigger objects have greater inertia and lighter or smaller objects have lesser inertia.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Second Law of Motion</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The second law of motion states that “<i>the rate of change of momentum of an object is proportional to the applied unbalanced force in the direction of the force</i>.”</p></li>
<li><p>The momentum (represented as p) of an object is defined as the product of its mass (represented as m) and velocity (represented as v).</p></li>
<li><p>Likewise, Momentum (m) = Mass (m) &times; Velocity (v).</p></li>
<li><p>Momentum possesses both the direction as well as magnitude.</p></li>
<li><p>The SI unit of momentum is represented as kilogram-meter per second (kg m s<sup>-1</sup>).</p></li>
<li><p>The second law of motion illustrates a method to measure the force, which is acting on an object as a product of its mass and acceleration.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Third Law of Motion</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The third law of motion states that – “<i>to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction</i>.”</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/law_of_motion.jpg" alt="Law of Motion" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>It is important to remembered that the action and reaction always act on two different objects.</p></li>
<li><p>It is important to remember that action and reaction forces are always equal in magnitude, but these forces may not produce accelerations of equal magnitudes because each force acts on a different object, which may have a different mass.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Conservation of Momentum</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The conservation of momentum states that, in a given area, the amount of momentum remains constant.</p></li>
<li><p>The momentum is neither created nor destroyed; however, it can be changed through the action of forces (described by Newton's laws of motion).</p></li>
<li><p>The mass of an object multiplied by the velocity of the object is known as momentum.</p></li>

<h2>Universal Law of Gravitation</h2>

<h2>Free Fall</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Whenever an object falls towards the earth, it involves an acceleration; this acceleration is produces due to the earth’s gravitational force.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/free_fall.jpg" alt="Free Fall" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The acceleration, produces due to the earth’s gravitational force, is known as the acceleration due to the gravitational force of the earth (or acceleration due to gravity).</p></li>
<li><p>The acceleration produces due to the gravitational force is denoted by <b>g</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>As the radius of the earth increases towards the equator (from the poles) the value of <b>‘g’</b> becomes greater at the poles than at the equator.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>The Value of g</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Value of g is calculated as &minus;</p></li>

<h1>Physics - Mass and Weight</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The mass of an object is always constant and does not change from place to place.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/weight.jpg" alt="Weight" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The mass remains same whether the object is on the earth, the moon, or even in outer space.</p></li>
<li><p>The force of attraction of the earth (due to gravitational force) on an object is called as the <b>weight</b> of the object.</p></li>
<li><p>Weight is denoted by English capital letter ‘<b>W</b>.’</p></li>
<li><p>Weight is calculated as &minus;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>$$W = m \: \times \: g$$</p>
<p>Where,</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p><b>m</b> is equal to mass of the object.</p></li>
<li><p><b>g</b> is equal to the acceleration due to gravity.</p></li>
<li><p>The SI unit of weight is the same as that of force, i.e., newton (N).</p></li>
<li><p>Since, weight of an object is dependent on certain factors; therefore, weight is changeable (depending upon the place where it is), but mass of the same object remains constant irrespective of its location (where it is).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Thrust</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The force that acts on an object perpendicular to the surface is known as <b>thrust</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/thrust.jpg" alt="Thrust" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The effects of forces of the same magnitude on different areas are different because the effect of thrust depends on the area on which it acts.</p></li>
<li><p>For example, if someone is standing on loose sandy surface, then the force, that is, the weight of his body is acting on an area equal to area of his feet. But when he lies down on the same surface, the same force acts on an area equal to the contact area of his whole body, which is larger than the area of his feet. Thus the effect of thrust on sandy surface is larger while standing than while lying.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Pressure</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The thrust on unit area is known as pressure. It is calculated as &minus;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>$$Pressure = \frac{Thrust}{Area}$$</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The SI unit of pressure is known as <b>pascal</b>, symbolized as <b>Pa</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The same force, if acting on a smaller area, exerts a larger pressure, but if acting on a larger area, exerts smaller pressure. Because of this reason - a nail has a pointed tip, knives have sharp edges, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Buoyancy</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The upward force exerted by the water molecules on the object is known as up thrust or <b>buoyant force</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/buoyancy.jpg" alt="Buoyancy" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The magnitude of the buoyant force depends on the density of the water/fluid.</p></li>

<li><p>Mass of a unit volume is known as <b>density</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Archimedes’ Principle</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The force of buoyancy was first time noticed by Archimedes (a Greek Scientist) and to explain the phenomenon, he proposed a principle known as Archimedes’ Principle.</p></li>

<h1>Physics - Light</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h1>The Human Eye and The Colorful World</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The human eye is one of the most valuable and sensitive sense organs. It empowers us to see the wonderful and colorful things around us.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Human Eye</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The human eye is very much similar to a camera.</p></li>
<li><p>The lens system of an eye forms an image on a light-sensitive screen known as the <b>retina</b> (see the image given below).</p></li>
<li><p>Light enters the eye through a thin membrane known as the <b>cornea</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/eye.jpg" alt="Eye" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>With a diameter of about 2.3 cm, the eyeball is almost spherical in shape.</p></li>
<li><p>Behind the cornea, there is a structure, known as <b>iris</b> (see the image given above).</p></li>
<li><p>Iris is a dark muscular diaphragm; it has major function to control the size of the pupil.</p></li>
<li><p>The pupil has major function to control and regulate the amount of light entering the eye.</p></li>
<li><p>The lens of eye forms an inverted real image of an object on the retina.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Power of Accommodation</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The eye lens, which is composed of a fibrous, jelly-like material, has an important role; further, the change in the curvature of the eye lens also change the focal length.</p></li>
<li><p>When the muscles are in relax state, the lens shrinks and becomes thin; therefore, its focal length increases in this position and enables us to see the distant objects clearly.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, when you look at an object closer to your eye, the ciliary muscles contract; resultantly, the curvature of the eye lens increases and the eye lens becomes thicker. In such a condition, the focal length of the eye lens decreases, which enables us to see nearby objects clearly.</p></li>
<li><p>Such ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length is known as <b>accommodation</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Furthermore, the focal length of the eye lens cannot be decreased below a certain (minimum) limit. This is the reason that we cannot read the book kept very close to our eyes rather we have to maintain a certain distance.</p></li>
<li><p>To see an object comfortably and clearly, the object must be kept at the distance of (about) <b>25 cm</b> from the eyes.</p></li>
<li><p>However, there is no limit of the farthest point; a human eye can see objects of infinity, e.g. moon, stars, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Defects of Vision and Their Correction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>When the crystalline lens of an eye (normally at old age), becomes milky and cloudy, it is known as <b>cataract</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Cataract causes partial or complete loss of vision; however, it can be treated through a cataract surgery.</p></li>
<li><p>Following are the three common refractive defects of vision &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist"> 
<li><p>Myopia or near-sightedness</p></li>
<li><p>Hypermetropia or farsightedness, and</p></li>
<li><p>Presbyopia</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Let’s discuss each them in brief:</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Myopia</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Myopia is also known as near-sightedness.</p></li>
<li><p>A person suffering from myopia can see nearby objects clearly, but cannot see distant objects clearly.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/myopia.jpg" alt="Myopia" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>As shown in the image given above, in a <b>myopic eye</b>, the image of a distant object is formed in front of the retina instead of at the retina.</p></li>
<li><p>Myopia may arise because of &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist"> 
<li><p>Excessive curvature of the eye lens, or</p></li>
<li><p>Elongation of the eyeball.</p></li>
</ul>
</li> 
<li><p>This defect can be corrected by using a <b>concave lens</b> of suitable power.</p></li>
<li><p>As shown in the image given above, using of <b>concave lens</b> of suitable power, brings the image back on to the retina; likewise, the defect is corrected.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Hypermetropia</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Hypermetropia is also known as far-sightedness.</p></li>
<li><p>A person suffering from hypermetropia can see the distant objects clearly, but cannot see the nearby objects clearly.</p></li>
<li><p>In such a case, as shown in the image given below, the near point, is farther away from the normal near point (i.e. 25 cm).</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/hypermetropia.jpg" alt="Hypermetropia" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Hypermetropia may arise because of</p></li>
<li><p>The focal length of the eye lens – when it is too long, or</p></li>
<li><p>The eyeball has become too small.</p></li>
<li><p>Hypermetropia can be corrected by using a <b>convex lens</b> of appropriate power.</p></li>
<li><p>As shown in the image given above, eye-glasses with converging lenses provide the additional focusing power that helps in forming the image on the retina.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Presbyopia</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Presbyopia, an eye problem, arises because of the gradual weakening of the ciliary muscles and diminishing flexibility of the eye lens.</p></li>
<li><p>Some people suffer from both myopia and hypermetropia; such kind of eye defect is treated by using <b>bifocal</b> lenses.</p></li>
<li><p>A common type of bi-focal lenses consists of both the concave and the convex lenses.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Physics - Refraction of Light Through a Prism</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Prism is a triangular glass, which has two triangular bases and three rectangular lateral surfaces (as shown in the image given below).</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/prism.jpg" alt="Prism" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The unique shape of the prism makes the emergent ray bend at an angle to the direction of the incident ray and this angle is known as the <b>angle of deviation</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The angle between two lateral faces of a prism is known as the <b>angle of the prism</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Dispersion of White Light by a Glass Prism</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>As shown in the image given above, the prism has split the incident white light into a band of colors.</p></li>
<li><p>The various colors those are seen through prism are arranged in order; this order is named as ‘<b>VIBGYOR</b>.’</p></li>
<li><p>VIBGYOR is constituted after taking first letter of all the following colors &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p><b>V</b> &minus; Violet</p></li>
<li><p><b>I</b> &minus; Indigo</p></li>
<li><p><b>B</b> &minus; Blue</p></li>
<li><p><b>G</b> &minus; Green</p></li>
<li><p><b>Y</b> &minus; Yellow</p></li>
<li><p><b>O</b> &minus; Orange</p></li>
<li><p><b>R</b> &minus; Red</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The band of the colored components of a light beam is known as <b>spectrum</b> and VIBGYOR is the sequence of colors that you can see in the above image.</p></li>
<li><p>The splitting of light into different colors is known as <b>dispersion</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>All the colors have different bending angles in respect to the incident ray; the red light bends list (can be seen at the top) whereas the violet bends the most (see the image given above).</p></li>
<li><p>Because of having different bending angles, all the colors become distinct.</p></li>
<li><p>Newton was the first scientist who used a glass prism to obtain the spectrum of sunlight and he concluded that the sunlight is made up of seven colors.</p></li>
<li><p>A rainbow is a natural spectrum that most likely appears in the sky after a rain shower (see the image given below).</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/rainbow.jpg" alt="Rainbow" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Rainbow after the rain is normally result of dispersion of sunlight by the tiny water droplets.</p></li>
<li><p>The tiny water droplets present in the atmosphere act like small prisms.</p></li>
<li><p>A rainbow always forms in the opposite direction of the Sun.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Atmospheric Refraction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The deviation of light rays from a straight path in the atmosphere (normally because of variation in air density) is known as <b>atmospheric refraction</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Atmospheric refraction nearby the ground produces mirages, which means, the distance objects appear elevated or lowered, to shimmer or ripple, stretched or shortened, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>In the night, the stars appear twinkling, it is also because of the atmospheric refraction.</p></li>
<li><p>Because of the atmospheric refraction, the Sun remains visible and about 2 minutes after the actual sunset and about 2 minutes before the actual sunrise (see the image given below).</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/atmospheric_refraction.jpg" alt="Atmospheric Refraction" />
<h2>Tyndall Effect</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The earth’s atmosphere is largely constituted of a heterogeneous mixture, such as tiny water droplets, suspended particles of dust, smoke, and molecules of air. When a beam of light strikes through such fine particles, the path of the beam gets scattered. The phenomenon of scattering of light by the colloidal particles (of the atmosphere) gives rise to <b>Tyndall effect</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The scattering of light makes the particles visible in the atmosphere.</p></li>
<li><p>Very fine particles scatter largely blue light whereas particles of larger size scatter the light, which has longer wavelengths.</p></li>
<li><p>The red light has a wavelength (about) 1.8 times larger than the blue light.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Physics - Electricity</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

</ul>
<h2>Magnetic Field</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Magnetic field is a quantity, which has both magnitude and direction.</p></li>

<li><p>It is the convention that the field lines emerge from north pole and merge at the south pole (see the image given above).</p></li>
<li><p>No two field-lines of a magnet bar are found to cross each other. If it happens, then it means that at the point of intersection, the compass needle would point towards two directions, which is simply not possible.</p></li>

<h1>Physics - Sound Part I</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The <i>to</i> and <i>fro</i> or <i>back</i> and <i>forth</i> motion of an object is known as <b><i>vibration</i></b>. Therefore, when a tightly stretched band is plucked, it vibrates and when it vibrates, it produces <b>sound</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/band.jpg" alt="Band" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>In some cases, vibration can be easily observed, but in most of the cases, their amplitude is so small that it is very difficult to see them with naked eye; however, their vibration can be easily felt in the form of sound. E.g. Tabla, Harmonium, Flute, Sitar, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/instruments.jpg" alt="Instruments" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>In human beings, the sound is produced by the larynx (also known as voice box).</p></li>
<li><p>One can feel the vibration by keeping fingers on the throat; this is the part that is known as the voice box.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Sound Produced By Human Beings</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Two vocal cords (as shown in the given image), are stretched across the voice box (or larynx) in such a way that it leaves a narrow slit between them for the passage of air; this is how sound is produced.</p></li>
<li><p>The vocal cords in men are about 20 mm long.</p></li>
<li><p>The vocal cords in women are about 15 mm long and children’s vocal cords are even more shorter; this is the reason that men, women, and children have different voice.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/voice_box.jpg" alt="Voice Box" />
<h2>Human Ears</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The part through which we hear is known as <b>ear</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The shape of the outer part of the ear is similar to a funnel; therefore, when sound enters in it, it keeps going down through a canal to the end. At the end, there is a thin membrane stretched tightly; it is known as the <b>eardrum</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/ears.jpg" alt="Ears" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The eardrum is very similar to a stretched rubber sheet and sound vibrations make the eardrum vibrate.</p></li>
<li><p>The eardrum sends vibrations to the inner ear and from there, the signal goes to the brain; this is how we hear the sound clearly.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Frequency of A Vibration</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The vibration motion is known as <b>oscillatory motion</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The number of oscillations per second is known the <b>frequency</b> of oscillation and the frequency is expressed in <b>hertz</b> (Hz).</p></li>
<li><p>Amplitude and frequency are the two significant features of any sound.</p></li>
<li><p>The loudness of sound depends on its amplitude; if amplitude is higher, then the sound is louder and if the amplitude is lesser, then the sound is feeble.</p></li>

</ul>
<h1>Physics - Sound Part II</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Sound is a form of energy, which produces a sensation when we hear it in our ears.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/speakers.jpg" alt="Speakers" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Sound can be produce in number of ways, such as, by plucking, scratching, rubbing, blowing or shaking different objects.</p></li>
<li><p>The sound of the human voice is produced because of the vibrations in the vocal cords.</p></li>
<li><p>Sound waves are typically characterized by the motion/vibration of particles in the medium and hence known as <b>mechanical waves</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Sound waves oscillate back and forth on their position; hence, they are known as <b>longitudinal waves</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Propagation of Sound</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The substance or object through which sound is transmitted is known as <b>medium</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Sound moves through a medium from the point of the generation to the listener; the sound medium could be solid, liquid, or gas.</p></li>
<li><p>However, sound cannot travel through a vacuum medium.</p></li>
<li><p>The particles (of gas, liquid, or solid) do not travel all the way from the vibrating object to the ear, but rather when the object vibrates, it sets the particles of the medium around it vibrating and so on and so forth.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/propogation_of_sound.jpg" alt="Propogation of Sound" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>In other words, the particles of the medium do not travel/move forward, but rather the disturbance is carried forward through one vibrating particle to another.</p></li>
<li><p>When vibrating particles move forward, they push and compress the air in front of it and create a region of high pressure known as <b>compression</b> (see the image given below).</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/compression.jpg" alt="Compression" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Further, when the vibrating particles move backwards, it creates a region of low pressure known as <b>rarefaction</b> (R) (see the image given above).</p></li>
<li><p>As the particles move back and forth rapidly, a series of compressions (high pressure zone) and rarefactions (low pressure zone) is created in the air; likewise, the sound wave propagates through the medium.</p></li>
<li><p>As shown in the image given above, the lower portion (valley) of the curve is known as <b>trough</b> and the upper portion (peak) is known as <b>crest</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The distance between two consecutive compressions or two consecutive rarefactions is known as the <b>wavelength</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Wavelength is usually represented by the Greek letter lambda (<b>λ</b>) and its SI unit is meter (m).</p></li>
<li><p>The number of the compressions or rarefactions that counted per unit time is known as <b>frequency</b> of the sound wave.</p></li>
<li><p>Frequency of the sound wave is commonly represented by <b>ν</b> (Greek letter, nu).</p></li>
<li><p>The SI unit of frequency of the sound wave is hertz (Hz).</p></li>
<li><p>The sensation of a frequency that we sense/listen is usually referred as the <b>pitch</b> of a sound.</p></li>
<li><p>The faster the vibration of the sound source, the higher is the frequency and so the higher is the pitch (see the image given below).</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/pitch_of_sound.jpg" alt="Pitch of Sound" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Likewise, a high pitch sound has more number of compressions and rarefactions passing the fixed point per unit time.</p></li>
<li><p>The lower the vibration of the sound source, the lesser is the frequency and so the lesser is the pitch (see the image given below).</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/high_pitch.jpg" alt="High Pitch" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Likewise, a lower pitch sound has less number of compressions and rarefactions passing the fixed point per unit time.</p></li>
<li><p>The magnitude of the maximum disturbance in the given medium on either side of the mean value is known as the <b>amplitude</b> of the sound wave.</p></li>
<li><p>Amplitude is commonly represented by the letter <b>A</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The softness or loudness of a sound is fundamentally determined by its amplitude.</p></li>
<li><p>A sound of single frequency is known as <b>tone</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The sound, which is created by mixing of several harmonious frequencies, is known as <b>note</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Note is pleasant in listening.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Physics - Speed of Sound in Different Media</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The speed of sound depends on the type and properties of the medium through which it is traveling.</p></li>
<li><p>The speed of sound in a particular medium depends on temperature and pressure of that medium.</p></li>
<li><p>The speed of sound decreases when it passes from solid to gaseous state of a given medium.</p></li>

<h2>Sonic Boom</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>When the speed of any object surpasses the speed of sound waves, the speed of respective object is known as <b>supersonic speed</b>. For example, the speed of bullets, jet aircrafts, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/aircraft.jpg" alt="Aircraft" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>When a sound producing source itself moves with a speed higher than that of the sound, it produces the <b>shock waves</b> in air.</p></li>
<li><p>The shock waves carry a large amount of energy, which causes air pressure variation in its immediate environment.</p></li>
<li><p>The shock waves produce a very sharp and loud sound, which is known as <b>sonic boom</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/sonic_boom.jpg" alt="Sonic Boom" />
<h2>Reflection of Sound</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>When sound waves strike with a solid wall or even liquid, it gets reflected back.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Echo</h3>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>If you shout or clap in a (especially) mountains region, after a while, you will hear the same sound, it is known as <b>echo</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The sensation of sound continues in our brain for about 0.1 s; therefore, to hear a distinct echo sound, the time interval between the original sound and the reflected sound must be at least 0.1s.</p></li>
<li><p>To hear the distinct echo sound, the minimum distance of the obstacle from the source of sound must be 17.2 m. However, this distance is variable, as depends on temperature.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Reverberation</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The repeated reflection that results in the persistence of sound waves is known as <b>reverberation</b>. E.g. in a big hall (especially, an auditorium), the excessive reverberation can be heard.</p></li>
<li><p>Usually, the ceilings of concert or movie halls are given curved shape so that the sound waves after reflection reach all the corners of the hall (see the image given below).</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/physics_part1/images/reverberation.jpg" alt="Reverberation" />
<h2>Range of Audible Sound</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The audible range of sound for the human beings varies between 20 Hz to 20000 Hz.</p></li>
<li><p>However, as people grow older their ears gradually become less sensitive to higher the sound frequencies.</p></li>
<li><p>The sounds of frequencies less than 20 Hz are known as <b>infrasonic sound</b> or <b>infrasound</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Whales, rhinoceroses, and elephants produce sound in the infrasound range.</p></li>
<li><p>The sound of frequencies higher than 20 kHz are known as <b>ultrasonic sound</b> or <b>ultrasound</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Ultrasound technology is used extensively in different industries and for the medical purposes.</p></li>
<li><p>Dolphins, bats, and porpoises produce ultrasound sound.</p></li>
</ul>
