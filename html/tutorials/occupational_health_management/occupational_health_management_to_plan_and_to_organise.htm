<p>The first and foremost essential element within a hazardous occupational workplace is the abundance of planning and organisation. The risk within these workplaces can be significantly diminished by anticipating and implementing precautionary measures within the worksite before the commencement of the work. This chapter deals with three aspects of planning, they are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The development of an organisational structure for the whole site’s operation.</p></li>
<li><p>Establishment of a comprehensive work plan considering each phase of the operation.</p></li>
<li><p>Establishment and implementation of a site safety and work plan.</p></li>
</ul> 
<img src="/occupational_health_management/images/site_safety_and_work_plan.jpg" alt="Site Safety and Work Plan" />
<p>Planning should be perceived as a perpetual process. Depending on the conditions of the site, the site safety plan must be changed to suit the need at hand. Thus, the primary intention behind this chapter is to lay down a starting point for the activities involved in planning within an occupational setting.</p>
<h2>The Structure of Organisation</h2>
<p>The structure of the organisation founding the overall objectives of the project must be laid out in the first phase of the planning process. The following conditions must be followed by the structure &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Appoint a leader and make him the authority that directs all the activities.</p></li>
<li><p>Appoint all the other human resources required to undertake the project in their respective field of expertise.</p></li>
<li><p>Define the lines between responsibility, communication, and authority.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>With the progress of the project, some necessary changes must be made to the organisational factors like authorities and individual responsibilities. This is crucial to streamline the performance of individual tasks. In the case of these changes, the changes must be updated across all the documents and must be conveyed to all the parties involved.</p>
<p>The following figure represents an example of a framework an organisation can be based upon. It deals with twenty-four categories of offsite as well as onsite personnel.</p>
<img src="/occupational_health_management/images/framework_an_organisation.jpg" alt="Framework an Organisation" />
<p>In the above illustration, the personnel are categorized on the basis of their responsibilities and roles within the occupational environment. They are also divided into offsite and onsite categories depending on their designation.</p>
<p>We are attempting to comprehend the scope of responsibilities and roles to be covered by this example. In order to design an organisational structure, the above illustration and its categorisation can be used as a skeletal structure or a starting point.</p>
<p>For an organisation of a smaller scale, several of the above functions may be performed by a single person. However, irrespective of the size of an effort, the presence of a site safety and health officer is a must across all response teams. The safety and health officer will be responsible for the implementation of all the health and safety measures.</p>
<img src="/occupational_health_management/images/health_and_safety_measures.jpg" alt="Health and Safety Measures" />
<p>The Site Safety Officer should easily be able to communicate with all the other occupational safety professionals, specifically with the industrial hygiene specialist.</p>
<p>Upon the successful establishment of the organisational system, all the individuals responsible for its reinforcement should be identified as they must explain the respective job roles to all the safety professionals in the response team.</p>
<p>The attitude of the project managers across all levels of the organisation is another crucial aspect in the field of workplace safety. An ideal project manager must be committed to all the intricate aspects of the workers’ safety and must prioritise the safety of the workers over the successful completion of the project before the deadlines.</p>
<p>The attitude, in the beginning, sets the nuance for the entire span of the project. The Project Manager and the Site Safety Officer need to be supported by the senior management for the successful establishment and implementation of safety programs.</p>
<p>Several factors within the organisation indicate the successful implementation of worker safety programs. Some of these factors are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The actions and the involvement of the management in worker safety reflect their strong determination and promise towards worker safety.</p></li>
<li><p>Open communications regarding safety and other job-related matters are openly discussed between the workers, managers and supervisors.</p></li>
<li><p>The cleanliness within the workplace is well maintained and the workplace is well organised, safeguarded against any airborne contamination.</p></li>
<li><p>The organisation has a well-established recruitment process and employee support.</p></li>
<li><p>The management does not shy out on applying variations in its safety program to better suit the task at hand.</p></li>
<li><p>The management organises certain disciplinary plans to ensure that its employees adhere to the proposed safety practices.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>The responsibility of the Offsite Personnel</h2>
<p>Although, most of the Offsite personnel belong to the senior management level in the hierarchy. It is the decision taken by them that determines the trajectory of various aspects such as worker safety within an organisation. In fact, every facet of the organisation depends on the decision taken by these individuals.</p>
<p>Let us now learn about major roles and responsibilities related to safety &minus;</p>

<li><p>Provision of human resource and the time required by them to finish the work at hand.</p></li>
<li><p>Appreciation of the efforts of the onsite management and work in proper sync with them.</p></li>
<li><p>Taking strict disciplinary measures in the case of unsafe work practices.</p></li>
</ul>
