<h1>Lohagarh Fort - History</h1>
<p>Bharatpur was named after <b>Lord Rama’s</b> brother <b>Bharata</b> who ruled <b>Ayodhya</b> when his brother with his wife <b>Sita</b> and brother <b>Laxman</b> went for exile of 14 years. The family of Bharatpur made Laxman their family deity and engraved his name on their arms, seals and other emblems.</p>
<h3>Bharatpur under Sogariya Clan</h3>
<p>Rustam of Sogariya clan founded <b>Chau Burj</b> and after the declination of the Mughal Empire, he established himself in mewat region. Khemkaran, successor of Rustam lost to Raja Suraj Mal.</p>
<h2>Bharatpur under Churaman</h2>
<p><b>Churaman</b> was a Jat who helped the peasants to get rid of the tyranny and ill-treatment by the Mughals. Churaman rose against Mughals but was defeated and killed. He was succeeded by <b>Badan Singh</b>.</p>
<h2>Bharatpur under Badan Singh</h2>
<p>After the death of Churaman, Badan Singh brought the Jats together and began to control a large part of territory. Mughal emperor of his time gave him the title of Raja. Badan Singh established himself as a ruler in 1722 and made <b>Deeg</b> his capital. He constructed a royal palace which is now called as <b>Old Palace</b> or <b>Purana Mahal</b>. Deeg was under constant threat of attacks, so prince Suraj Mal built a fort with deep moat and towering walls.</p>
<h2>Bharatpur under Suraj Mal</h2>
<p>Raja Badan Singh was succeeded by Raja Suraj Mal who built many forts and palaces in order to protect his kingdom from attacks. Lohagarh Fort was also built by him. Suraj Mal was succeeded by Jawahar Singh.</p>
<img src="/lohagarh_fort/images/raja_suraj_mal.jpg" alt="Raja Suraj Mal" />
<h2>Bharatpur under Jawahar Singh</h2>
<p>Raja Suraj Mal was succeeded by Jawahar Singh. Once Jawahar Singh went with his mother for Pushkar bath. He was asked to bathe in mud bank but he saw the beautiful bathing enclosures and took bath there. He also constructed a new one. Raja of Jaipur became furious with this act and attacked Raja Jawahar Singh but later he was humbled so Jawahar Singh returned back to Bharatpur.</p>
<h2>Lohagarh Fort</h2>
<p>Lohagarh Fort was built in 18<sup>th</sup> century by Raja Suraj Mal. Besides this, Suraj Mal built many other forts and palaces. Lohagarh Fort is considered as one of the strongest fort as British could not capture it in spite of several attacks. Lord Lake made a siege of the fort in 1805 for six weeks but in spite of so many attacks he couldn’t annex it.</p>
<p>Jawahar Burj and the Fateh Burj were built to celebrate the victory over Mughals and British. The fort is surrounded by deep moats. There is a legend which states that the fort will fall down if a crocodile takes up all the water of the moats. There is also a legend which states that a gate of the fort was brought from Delhi which <b>Alauddin Khilji</b> brought from the fort of Chittorgarh. The gate was brought and fixed in the fort in 17<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<h2>Attack on the fort by British</h2>
<p>General Lake wanted to create enmity between Rajput and Marathas so he reminded Raja Ranjeet of the treaty. At that time Holker was in his protection and Raja refused to hand him to the British. British laid a siege on the fort and attacked it under the command of Lake but were defeated badly. Many of their soldiers and officers were killed. After two days British broke the wall and the Jats attacked them through artillery.</p>
<p>In the third attack, the British successfully crossed the moat but the attack of Jats filled the moat with the bodies of soldiers. General Lake was asked to have a peace treaty but he refused saying that reinforcement is coming. The combined forces of Holker, Amir Khan and Ranjeet Singh attacked on the British.</p>
<p>When the British force was reinforced from the troops that came from Mumbai and Chennai, they renewed the attack. The British solders were attacked by boulders but still some of them succeeded to enter the fort but British suffered heavy losses. Around 3000 were killed and several thousand were injured. After this Lake went into peace treaty with the Rajputs.</p>
<h1>Lohagarh Fort - Architecture</h1>
<p>Lohagarh Fort has been built by Maharaja Suraj Mal in 1732 on an artificial island. The outer walls of the fort have thick walls made up of mud. The fort was impregnable due to these mud walls because the cannons fired on the fort were sunk in the mud. These cannons were later used by the army of the maharaja to attack on the enemy. The construction of the fort took eight years to complete. The British took over the fort and broke the walls in 1826. Some of the structures inside the fort are as follows &minus;</p>
<h2>Ashtadhatu Gate</h2>
<p>Ashtadhatu Gate is the main entrance to the fort. The spikes of the gate were made up of eight metals that’s why the gate is called ashtadhatu or eight metal gate. Here <b>ashta</b> means <b>eight</b> and <b>dhatu</b> means <b>metal</b>. The gate has rounded bastions along with paintings of war elephants. It is believed that the gate belonged to the <b>Chittorgarh Fort</b> which was brought by <b>Alauddin Khilji</b> to Delhi. In 1764, Raja Jawahar Singh brought the gate to Lohagarh Fort.</p>
<img src="/lohagarh_fort/images/ashtadhatu_gate.jpg" alt="Ashtadhatu Gate" />
<h2>Lohiya Gate</h2>
<p>Lohiya Gate is situated at the south of the fort. It was also brought from Delhi as it was a part of Chittorgarh Fort and brought to Delhi by Alauddin Khilji.</p>
<h2>Sandstone Durbar</h2>
<p>Sandstone Durbar or Maharaja Meeting Hall was a hall where the king used to have public and private meetings. The walls of the hall are carved, and the hall also has pillars and archways. The hall has now been converted into a museum.</p>
<h2>Moat</h2>
<p>The fort is surround by moat whose width is 250feet and depth is 20 feet. After digging the moat a wall of the height of 25 feet and width of 30 feet was constructed. The fort has ten gates to enter and exit. Each door led to the main road and there was a moat in front of the road whose width was 175 feet and depth was 40 feet.</p>
<img src="/lohagarh_fort/images/moat.jpg" alt="Moat" />
<h2>Walls of the Fort</h2>
<p>The walls of the main building of the fort has the height of 100 feet and width of 30 feet. The outer part was made up of brick and mortar but the inner part was made up of mud. The interior portion was not affected by the firing of cannons.</p>
<h2>Burj</h2>
<p>There were eight burjs or towers in the fort out of which Jawahar Burj is the highest. Big cannon-on-wheels were installed on these towers. The cannon-on-wheels had so much weight that around 40 pairs of bulls were used to pull the weapon. Many small cannon-on-wheels were also installed that were either robbed during a war or were bought by the king.</p>
<h2>Jawahar Burj and Fateh Burj</h2>
<p>Jawahar Burj was built by Raja Sawai Jawahar Singh in 1765 to commemorate his victory over Mughals. Jawahar Burj was also used for the coronation ceremony of the rulers. The ceiling of the burj has frescoes which are deteriorating now. There is also a series of pavilions in the burj. Fateh Burj was built by Raja Ranjeet Singh in the commemoration of his win over the British. The burj was constructed in 1805.</p>
<h2>Vijay Stambh</h2>
<p>Vijay Stambh or <b>Victory Column</b> is an iron pillar which consists of the lineage of Jat kings. Starting from <b>Lord Krishna,</b> the genealogy leads to <b>Sindhupal</b> who was the 64<sup>th</sup> descendent of Lord Krishna. It goes up to <b>Maharaja Brijendra Singh</b> who ruled from 1929 to 1948. The mentioned rulers in the genealogy belong to <b>Yaduvanshi Jat</b>.</p>
<h2>Mahal Khas</h2>
<p>Mahal Khas was built by Suraj Mal who reigned from 1733 to 1763. The roofs of the palace are curved and caved brackets were used to support the balconies. All this construction was a part of Jat architecture. One more Mahal Khas is there on the eastern side of the fort which was built by Raja Balwant Singh who ruled from 1826 to 1853.</p>
