<h1>BMX - Overview</h1>
<p>BMX is an off-road sports similar to that of mountain biking where bikers use specially designed BMX bikes. Since 2008, BMX has been included in Summer Olympics while freestyle BMX has been one of the staple events at the Summer X Games Extreme Sports Competitions.</p>
<p>In this game, the rider performs moderate-to-high level of riding on off-road locations and compete with other riders while maintaining balance on the bike. Depending on the game type, the bike riders have to reach the finishing line as fast as possible. The first three riders to finish the race are declared winners. They have to complete all the laps before reaching the finishing point.</p>
<img src="/bmx/images/finishing_point.jpg" alt="Finishing Point." />
<p>In case of <b>Freestyle BMX</b>, the players have to perform various tricks on the bike itself while balancing it. There is no racing involved. However based on the player’s efficiency to perform tricks, winners are decided by a panel of judges.</p>
<h2>History of BMX</h2>
<p>BMX began in South California in early 1970s when children started racing on their bicycles on dirt tracks while imitating their motocross stars. Initially Schwinn StingRay bikes were used as the BMX bike because of better handling and performance. Gradually the sport started gaining soaring popularity and the number of race tracks started growing everywhere.</p>
<p>In 1977, American Bicycle Association (ABA) was founded as the national sanctioning body whereas in April 1981, International BMX Federation was founded and the first BMX world championship was held in 1982. In 1983, it has been integrated into Union Cyclist International (UCI). It has been included in Summer Olympics as a full medal sports since 2003.</p>
<img src="/bmx/images/history_of_bmx.jpg" alt="History of BMX" />
<p>Freestyle was developed as a way to introduce more styles and it gained popularity rapidly because of its relative ease and availability of places to ride. After a while it was added in the Summer X Games Extreme Sports competition.</p>
<p>The American Freestyle Association (AFA) was the first governing committee of BMX freestyle and in 1984, first Freestylin' Magazine was published. Slowly the game gained much popularity to attract different manufacturers and investors.</p>
<h2>Participating Countries</h2>
<p>For years, it has been a rage among the youths and a real fun game for the audiences because of its adventurous stunts and sheer entertainment. Presently, in more than 80 countries around the world, BMX is considered as a top-level competitive sport.</p>
<p>BMX is immensely popular in Canada, Australia, USA, Japan, France, New Zealand, Netherlands, Czech Republic, Argentina, Switzerland, Italy, and South Africa. In these countries, a large number of players participate in BMX.</p>
<h1>BMX - Equipment</h1>
<p>BMX racing is an adventure sport in which the rider has to show some stunts while racing. In freestyle BMX, there is no racing and the rider wins the game according to the trick he shows in the event. In this chapter, we will discuss the equipment used in this sport.</p>
<h2>BMX Bikes</h2>
<p>BMX bikes are off-road sports bicycles that are mostly used for racing and stunt riding purpose. Except motocross tracks, these bikes are used in skate parks, dirt tracks, vert ramps, streets, and flat lands.</p>
<p>These bikes are strongly built and are made of various types of steels whereas in most of the race bikes, frames are made of Aluminum. High-performance bikes are mostly made of generation 3 Chromalloy (high tensile steel).</p>
<img src="/bmx/images/bmx_bikes.jpg" alt="BMX Bikes" />
<p>The wheel size of a standard BMX bike is between 16 inches to 24 inches. The bikes with 24 inch wheel size are also known as <b>cruiser bikes</b>. The players can use these bikes to jump easily as compared to 20 inch wheel size bikes.</p>
<p>The wheels of this bike mainly consist of 36 spokes, however some aggressive riders use bikes with 48 spokes.</p>
<p><b>Cassette hubs</b> are used in small gearing of BMX bikes because of its lightweight and more clearance during <b>grinding</b>.</p>
<p><b>Axle pegs</b> are often used in free riding bikes to help riders while performing stunts.</p>
<img src="/bmx/images/cassette_hubs.jpg" alt="Cassette hubs" />
<p>In case of dirt jumping and freestyles, BMX bike wheel sizes are around 20 inches for experienced bikers and 16 inches for young bikers. They usually don’t have front brakes whereas freestyle bikes have both front and rear brakes with more sturdy constructions in order to handle the aggressive riding.</p>
<p>Based on their game type, design and tracks used, different types of BMX bikes are used. Some of them are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Park bikes</b> &minus; Lightweight bikes mainly used in <b>skate parks</b> and <b>vert ramps</b>. Excess weights are avoided during construction for smooth transition of the bike.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Dirt bikes</b> &minus; Dirt bikes are same as park bikes but the tyres have comparatively thicker tread to make grip on loose surfaces.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Race bikes</b> &minus; Race bikes are mostly used in motocross tracks and feature both rear and front brakes for better control. They are lighter than freestyle bikes and also contain a large front sprocket which enables the rider to pedal at high speed. These bikes are built for speed and are mostly made of Aluminium.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Street Bikes</b> &minus; These are often used in streets and rails and have metal pegs for grinding on rails. These bikes are stronger and heavier as compared to other BMX bikes with almost no brake and brake cables which enables the rider to spin the bar easily.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Flatland bikes</b> &minus; These bikes are used mostly in flat surfaces and don’t include any jumps or ramps. Using this kind of bike, the player performs many tricks on various parts of the bike. A rear brake cable de-tangler is added in order to prevent the tangling of brake cables while rotating the bars.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In order to allow riders to perform stunts while taking those bolts as support, front and rear bolt-on pegs are also added.</p>
<p>Because of the extremeness of the sport, accidents and injuries are pretty common in the game. While racing or trying to pull off a stunt, spills or crashes are very much likely to happen. In order to keep these injuries to minimum BMX riders take many safety measures.</p>
<h2>Safety Equipment</h2>
<p>The equipment that are used in BMX for the sake of player’s safety and protection are &minus;</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td width="75%"><p><b>Helmets</b> &minus; In order to avoid serious head injuries, helmets are used in BMX. In case of BMX racing, full-face helmets are used for avoiding injuries during collision with other racers.</p></td>
<td><img src="/bmx/images/helmets.jpg" alt="Helmets"/></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="75%"><p><b>Body armours</b> &minus; These armours can be kneepads for the player’s knee injuries and pain. Similarly shin pads and wrist and elbow pads for arms are also used.</p></td>
<td><img src="/bmx/images/armour.jpg" alt="Armours"/></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="75%"><p><b>Gloves</b> &minus; As during the race, player’s hands get too sweaty, gloves are used for better grip and protection.</p></td>
<td><img src="/bmx/images/gloves.jpg" alt="Gloves"/></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="75%"><p><b>Shoes</b> &minus; Specially designed shoes for BMX racing are made for racers which cover their entire feet. The shoes have grooves on their soles to fit properly on the pedals.</p></td>
<td><img src="/bmx/images/shoes.jpg" alt="Shoes"/></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="75%"><p><b>Pants</b> &minus; Lightweight Motocross racing pants that are made of nylon or sail clothes are used in BMX. These pants cannot be torn easily.</p></td>
<td><img src="/bmx/images/pants.jpg" alt="Pants"/></td>
</tr>

<h1>BMX - Playing Environment</h1>
<p>Different tracks are used for various BMX sports, as different kinds of stunts are to be performed by the participants. In case of <b>BMX racing,</b> the competition is performed in motocross tracks filled with jumps and rolling, whereas in case of <b>freestyle BMX</b>, it is performed in skate parks, vert ramps, rails, flat surfaces, etc.</p>
<img src="/bmx/images/different_tracks.jpg" alt="Different Tracks" />
<h2>BMX Racing</h2>
<p>In case of BMX racing, the tracks are around 400 meters long with a large starting ramp. In order to make the race more entertaining as well as adventurous, special features are added in the track, which are also a part of the BMX track. Here is a list of those features &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Starting Hill</b> &minus; It is present at the starting of the track and mostly has a gate. It is very much similar to an inclined slope i.e. used to provide the initial speed boost for the riders.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Step up</b> &minus;  Step up is defined as an obstacle type in the BMX track which comprises of a short hill followed by a large hill.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Berms</b> &minus; These are the level barriers placed at an angle at turns in order to help racers turn smoothly without applying brakes.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Doubles</b> &minus; It is another type of obstacle where two similar sized hills are placed near to each other.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Step down</b> &minus; It is opposite of the step up. It comprises of a larger hill followed by a shorter hill.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Roller</b> &minus; It is comprised of a group of small hills.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Panettone</b> &minus; It is a flat jump, mainly used for the learning purpose.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Freestyle BMX</h2>
<p>In case of Freestyle BMX, the sport is stunt oriented and based on different disciplines of free style racing. For each race different racing venues are followed. Different types of freestyle BMX tracks are explained below &minus;</p>
<p><b>Street</b> &minus; In Street BMX, the riders usually use public spaces for performing different stunts and tricks. Mostly tricks are performed on handrails, curbs, stairs, ledges, banks etc. The tricks of the riders vary from each other based on their urban surrounding in case of street BMX.</p>
<img src="/bmx/images/street_bmx.jpg" alt="Street BMX" />
<p><b>Park</b> &minus; These parks often denote skate parks, which are mostly used by different extreme sport players like skateboarders, skaters and BMX riders. These parks are mainly made of wood, concrete, or metal and the style of riding depends on the skate park design style.</p>
<p>Concrete parks are mainly made because of their long durability whereas some prefer wood parks because of low cost materials as well as ease of construction. In case of BMX parks, round steel tubes called coping are used to prevent damages.</p>
<p><b>Vert</b> &minus; Vert rams are very much popular in most of the extreme sports. Here the tricks are performed on a half-pipe which consists of two quarter pipes of height 10 to 15 feet. The quarter pipes face each other in order to do stunts. Steel copings are added on the vert lips which enable riders to grind on it. A typical run involves moving one side to other side while performing various tricks in the middle.</p>
<img src="/bmx/images/perform_jumps.jpg" alt="Perform Jumps" />
<p><b>Trails</b> &minus; Trails are made from dirt in which riders have to perform jumps. The rider has to perform steep take off called lip and steep landing which are separated by a gap which can be of 2 feet to 20 feet. The gape of 12 feet is considered as the moderate gap.</p>
<h1>How to Play BMX?</h1>
<p>BMX racing is organized on a ground having jumps and the rider who performs all the jumps successfully and reaches the destination is declared as winner. So no tricks are needed to be performed.</p>
<p>However in case of freestyle BMX, the players perform a lot of tricks while riding the bike. The tricks performed in freestyle BMX are as follows &minus;</p>
<h2>Air Tricks</h2>
<p>Some of the air tricks that are performed by the riders in freestyle BMX while being in air are explained below.</p>
<p><b>Tabletop</b> &minus; In case of this trick, the rider tries to bring the bike to one of his side by turning the handle as well as his body while being in the air. As a result of which the bike looks flat like a table top surface.</p>
<img src="/bmx/images/tabletop.jpg" alt="Tabletop" />
<p><b>Superman</b> &minus; Similar to dirt jumping here in this trick, the rider removes his feet from the pedals and extends them to the outward direction while still holding the handles of the bike, which looks like superman flying in air.</p>
<p><b>Superman seat grab</b> &minus; It is very much similar to that of superman where the rider takes his one hand off and grab the seat before grabbing back the bars again while landing.</p>
<img src="/bmx/images/superman_seat_grab.jpg" alt="Superman seat grab" />
<p><b>Tail whip</b> &minus; It is a very difficult trick in which a rider throws the bike while still holding the handle bars as a result of which the bike makes a full 360 degree rotation around the steering tube. After the rotation, the biker again stands on the pedals before landing.</p>

<h1>BMX - Rules</h1>
<p>Based on different BMX types, different strategies and tricks are followed. In case of BMX racing, it is a straight forward racing sport where the players have to compete with each other on the motocross track. In case of Freestyle BMX, people have to perform various tricks on different types of surfaces.</p>
<p><b>BMX racing</b> &minus; It’s a flat-out racing, where the players have to ride their BMX bikes as fast as possible while maintaining their balance on the race track. Initially the riders start from a high drop inclined slope for the initial speed boost then they need to move through the track which comprises of funky jumps, corners as well as rolling and other obstacles.</p>
<img src="/bmx/images/racing.jpg" alt="Racing" />
<p>Initially eight riders compete with each other in a track which is around 350-400 meters long. The bikers have to move really fast in order to complete the race. The first three players to complete the race are declared winners.</p>
<p><b>Freestyle BMX</b> &minus; In case of freestyle BMX, there is no race involved in this sport. So no race courses or tracks are there in freestyle BMX. Here ramps and different surfaces like trails; rail bars are constructed for the rider to perform tricks and stunts on it.</p>
<p>Each rider gets a certain amount of time to perform different tricks and stunts which is then rated by the judges. Those tricks are mostly pre-planned by the rider. Based on his performance the rider earns points. The rider earning maximum points wins the game.</p>
<h1>BMX - Champions</h1>
