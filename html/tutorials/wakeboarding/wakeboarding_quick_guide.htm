<h1>Wakeboarding - Overview</h1>
<p>All extreme sports require high degree of preparedness, physical as well as emotional strength, and stamina. Wakeboarding is one of such sports. In this sport, the player rides over the surface of water using a flat and long wakeboard that is towed behind a motorboat moving at a speed of 30 to 40km/hr.</p>
<p>Wakeboarding was invented around the 1980s. Initially, it used to be known as <b>Skurfing</b>. The sport was originated in Australia and New Zealand. Initially they used binding- less, hand shaped boards for towing.</p>
<p>The first wakeboard was called <b>Skurfer</b> and it used to look like a surfboard with pointed nose, rounded pin surfboard like fins. In 1983, Howard Jacobs created several wakeboards by mounting wind-surfing foot straps and partial hydro slide-pads on smaller surfboards. He shaped such surfboard first with added sophistication.</p>
<img src="/wakeboarding/images/skurfer.jpg" alt="Skurfer" />
<p>Paul Frase, his brother Murray, and a pro-snowboarder sponsored by them re-named this sport as <b><i>Wakeboarding</i></b>. Paul approached Herb O'Brien, the icon of wakeboarding, who later manufactured the world’s first hyper lite wakeboard in 1991. It was world’s first compressionmolded boards. The hyper lite boards helped a much easier start of the game and played a vital role in increasing the popularity of the sport.</p>
<h2>Wakeboarding – Objective</h2>
<p>In this sport, the players need to perform different tricks and stunts while maintaining proper control and balance on the wakeboard being towed in the water.</p>
<p>Based on the player’s control and skills, and the selection as well as execution of the skills, a panel of three judges records the performance of the players. The player with highest score is declared as a winner.</p>
<h2>Wakeboarding – Regulating Bodies</h2>
<p>The World Skiboard Association (WSA) founded in 1989 under whose command the first World Skiboarding Championship was held and this game was added in X games.</p>
<p>The regulating body WSA was renamed as World Wakeboard Association (WWA) in 1993 by the riders for the riders governs, promotes, and persuades to grow the wakeboard sports around the world. The association has given a number of amateur and professional wakeboard players, rules, regulations, and competitions since the last 27 years.</p>
<p>Yet another regulating body named The International Water ski and Wakeboard Federation (IWWF) organizes wakeboarding game competitions worldwide. It is also recognized as the official partner in wakeboarding by the Olympic committee.</p>
<h2>Wakeboarding – Participating Countries</h2>
<p>As an extreme sport, Wakeboarding is presently the world’s fastest-growing as well as one of the most accessible sports. The rapid growth of this game has made it one of the most famous global past time around the world. The unique style of the game as well as the free style creativity involved in the game has made it one of the biggest sport phenomenon in the present time.</p>
<img src="/wakeboarding/images/phenomenon.jpg" alt="Phenomenon" />
<p>Some of the countries where wakeboarding is very much popular both as a sports as well as an recreational activity are: Netherlands, Germany, Russia, Great Britain, USA, Austria, Mexico, Poland, Belgium, and Norway.</p>
<h1>Wakeboarding - Equipment</h1>
<p>The equipment required for an extreme sport are equally important in contribution to the player’s performance. Since wakeboarding is an extreme game with involvement of adventure and energy of the rider, the comfort level of the rider with equipment also matters primarily.</p>
<p>Let us see, what all equipment are mandatory in this game &minus;</p>
<h2>The Wakeboard</h2>
<p>This is the most basic equipment of this sport. The present boards are of foam, honeycomb or wood mixed with resin and are coated with fiberglass. Metal screws are inserted in to it in order to attach bindings and fins.</p>
<img class="raligned" src="/wakeboarding/images/wakeboard.jpg" alt="Wakeboard" />
<p>The size of the wakeboards recommended is directly proportional to the rider’s weight. The width of the board affects the way it sits on the water.</p>
<p>Mostly the areas where the width of the board matters are: tip area, middle area, and the tail area. Narrower tips and tails make the board turn more aggressively whereas wider tails and tips allow the player to perform different tricks. The wider the middle area, the harder in bounces off and sits higher in the water.</p>
<p>The length of the board plays a vital role in deciding the riding style of the rider. While a smaller board feels lighter and spins faster but faces difficulty while landing where as a larger board moves slowly and smoothly.</p>
<p>The present wakeboards that are mostly used by the riders are 5 feet long with 2 feet width at the center with a blunt nose and tail.</p>
<h2>Types of Wakeboards</h2>
<p>A specific bending on the board from head to tail is called <b><i>Rocker</i></b>. Broadly there are five types of wakeboards depending on the rocker design &Minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Continuous</b> rocker</p></li>
<li><p><b>Hybrid</b> rocker</p></li>
<li><p><b>Three-Stage</b> rocker</p></li>
<li><p><b>Five Stage</b> rocker</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A continuous rocker is a smooth curve where as in case of a three-stage rocker, there are 2 prominent bends on the board.</p>
<img src="/wakeboarding/images/types.jpg" alt="Types" />
<p>The wakeboards with continuous rocker move fast as water flows without any disruption at the bottom of the board. In case of three-stage rocker, the board pushes more water at the front side which makes the ride slower.</p>
<p>The boards with three stage or five stage rockers help the riders to jump higher while performing tricks. The rocker and board profile determine the performance.</p>
<h2>Wakeboard Bottom Design</h2>
<p>There are different bottom designs in case of a wakeboard which may be concaves, channels or nothing. These designs define the functionality of the boards and how it rides through the water. The concaves at the bottoms create lift and make the board sit high on water.</p>
<img class="raligned" src="/wakeboarding/images/bottom_design.jpg" alt="Bottom Design" />
<p>Double concave at the middle of the bottom helps the board sit higher than that of single concaves. Channels at the bottom act like long fins and help the wakeboard edge harder. In case of channels at the middle of the bottom of the board, the board edges harder while sitting perfectly in the water.</p>
<p>In case of a featureless board at the bottom, the board moves smoothly with the length, width, and rocker of the board; deciding its speed. The attached fins decide the nature of the board.</p>
<h2>Wakeboard Fins</h2>
<img class="raligned" src="/wakeboarding/images/fins.jpg" alt="Fins" />
<p>Fins are a type of wakeboard components which are fixed below the board and act as a pair of grips which inhibits the flow of water during the travel. Fins are responsible for the controlled forward movement of the board during the travel.</p>
<p>The configurations as well as the placement of these fins are done according to the rider’s preferences.</p>
<p>Based on the type of tricks the player performs, different types of fins are changed. The usage of the fins make it easily maneuvered. The more closer the fins are to the center of the board, the quicker and better the board sits and moves on the water.</p>
<img class="raligned" src="/wakeboarding/images/wakeboard_fins.jpg" alt="Wakeboard Fins" />
<p>In case the fins are placed nearer to the tail and tip area, the board hooks more in the water and doesn’t sit well.</p>
<p>Different types of fins are used by the players based on their desired effects and performance of the player.</p>
<h2>Types of Wakeboard Fins</h2>
<p>Some of the wakeboard fins are described below &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Long based fins</b> &minus; These kinds of fins release better and give the board a smooth feel while riding flat on water. These fins hold up well on ramps and rails.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Moulded fins</b> &minus; These fins look like big channels and hold up against rails and ramps. These are more slippery as compared to other types.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Multi-finned set-ups</b> &minus; These kind of fins capture the maximum aggressiveness trough and in to the wake.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Canted side fins</b> &minus; These kinds of fins are leaned at an angle. They stay inactive while the board travels flat. But when the rider starts leaning on the edges, these fins help the board holding up more. These kinds of fins provide hard edges.</p></li>
<li><p><b>No fins</b> &minus; Some riders prefer to go with finless boards in case of a board specially designed for the cable parks and other uses.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Wakeboard Binding</h2>
<img class="raligned" src="/wakeboarding/images/binding.jpg" alt="Binding" />
<p>The binding are used to hold the rider’s feet in position during the travel. Those are connected to the board and the players need to put their foot in it. While the rider rides up the wake, the energy of the wake makes the rider airborne where the rider performs different tricks. These tricks vary from basic to advance.</p>
<p>Mostly two types of binding are used by the players which are &minus; <b><i>Open Toe</i></b> binding and <b><i>Closed Toe</i></b> binding. The open toe bindings look mostly like shoes with broad size and better toe movement whereas in case of closed toe binding, it brings more responsiveness to the board while moving the toes.</p>
<h2>Wakeboarding Boats</h2>
<p>The wakeboarding boats are different than regular boats. In case of wakeboarding boats, a <b><i>Wakeboard Tower</i></b> made of stainless steel or aluminum tubing is available with the pull point 2 meters off the water surface. These boats are made to keep water inside which makes them heavier.</p>
<img src="/wakeboarding/images/boats.jpg" alt="Boats" />
<p>By keeping the water inside, these boats try to pump out water which creates big wakes behind the boat. Also these boats have a massive engine which enables them to get fast acceleration enough to keep the player off the water.</p>
<h2>Supplementary Equipment for Wakeboarding</h2>
<p>The following supplementary equipment is used for wakeboarding &minus;</p>
<h3>Wet Suit</h3>
<img class="raligned" src="/wakeboarding/images/wet_suit.jpg" alt="Wet Suit" />
<p>The wet suits used by the players keep their body warm in case of cold water. These suits are tightly fit and don’t let water come inside.</p>
<p>These suits absorb very less amount of water. Some players don’t use wet suits as they restrict the legs as well as arm movements. This suit is mandatory in certain tournaments; otherwise it is not a must.</p>
<h3>Life vest</h3>
<img class="raligned" src="/wakeboarding/images/life_vest.jpg" alt="Life Vest" />
<p>Mostly used as a protective guard, these life vests also help the player stay on top of water.</p>
<p>In case the player falls down in the water while losing balance, these vests help him/her staying up the water.</p>
<h3>Wakeboard Line</h3>
<img class="raligned" src="/wakeboarding/images/wakeboard_line.jpg" alt="Wakeboard Line" />
<p>This is a connecting line between the boat and the player. One end of it is attached with the boat while at the other end there is a handlebar for the player to hold on.</p>
<p>The length of the wakeboard rope varies between 55 to 75 feet and players use it depending on their experience level. The most common rope length i.e. used by riders is 24-26 meters.</p>
<h3>Helmet</h3>
<p>Helmet is used as a protective measure as loosing balance and falling down in case of great speed can be dangerous.</p>
<h1>Wakeboarding - Playing Environment</h1>
<p>Wakeboarding can be played in lakes, rivers, and lake parks. There are more than 250 wake parks all over the world located in more than 30 countries including Germany, France, UK, USA, and Turkey.</p>
<h2>Wake Parks</h2>
<p>They are the water bodies with ample reservoir of water. In wakeboarding, the riders usually get pulled by a motorboat.</p>
<img src="/wakeboarding/images/wake_parks.jpg" alt="Wake Parks" />
<p>In the surface of these wakeboard lakes, different obstacles such as sliders and kickers are there for performing aerial tricks.</p>
<h2>Cable Wakeboarding</h2>
<p>It is just same as regular wakeboarding with one difference: In cable wakeboarding, the rider is not pulled by a motorboat. Instead, a system of overhead cables is used to pull the rider.</p>
<img src="/wakeboarding/images/cable_wakeboarding.jpg" alt="Cable Wakeboarding" />
<p>A wake park includes a lake being surrounded by masts which hold an overhead cable. The cable rotates in the designed direction around the lake and has number of carriers. The riders get pulled by ropes attached to these carriers.</p>
<h1>Wakeboarding - Tricks</h1>
<p>Similar to snowboarding and surfing, in this sport also, there are different tricks and techniques that can be performed by the player for extra points.</p>
<p>While the board has popped up on the surface of water, the rider usually performs different tricks on the wakeboard which provides extra scores based on the style and smooth execution.</p>
<p>To perform a trick, the main requirement of the rider is to jump the board to maximum height.

<h1>Wakeboarding - How to Play?</h1>
<p>As you know by now, wakeboarding water sport is the game of strength, endurance, speed, and tricks. While exercising and maintaining one’s physical strength well, the rider can actually start practicing the game in water with full preparation.</p>
<p>Here are the basic steps at the beginning of the game &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Enter into water with the board lying perpendicular to your body.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep your heels resting on the board’s heel side edge.</p></li>
<li><p>Hold the handle of the wakeboard that is connected to the boat.</p></li> 
<li><p>Once you are ready, indicate the boat driver to start the boat. Slowly, the boat is pushed against his/her feet.</p></li> 
</ul>
<img src="/wakeboarding/images/play.jpg" alt="Play" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Initially the boat moves with a slow and steady acceleration of 10-12 mph. As the boat takes speed gradually, it is popped on the water surface.</p></li> 
<li><p>Once up on the water surface, push the board using your forward leg which will work as an accelerator to make the player move closer to the board. Pushing the board on your back foot slows the board and creates more distance between the board and the boat.</p></li> 
<li><p>After a while, will find the place where you need not have to use the rope tension but you are simply pushed by the wakes produced by the boats.</p></li>
<li><p>Based on your comfort, you can lock the speed and acceleration of the boat.</p></li>
<li><p>Start riding the board sideways with the knees bent towards the chest and the arms holding the handlebar of the wakeboard rope. Point your toes towards the boat to reduce the drag of the boat against the water and make it pop up more easily on the water surface.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the board starts moving smoothly on the top of water, you can perform different tricks against the wakes created by the boat.</p></li>
</ul>
