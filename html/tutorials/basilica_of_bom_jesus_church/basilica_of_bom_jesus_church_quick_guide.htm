<p>People of all communities can come here to visit the church as it is believed that saint has miraculous power of healing. People are given a chance to see the body of the saint after every 10 years.</p>

<h2>Alexio de Menezes</h2>
<p>Alexio de Menezes was the archbishop of Goa who declared the church as sacred in 1605 after its construction. Alexio lived from 1559 to 1617.

<h1>Basilica of Bom Jesus Church - Architecture</h1>
<p>The church was constructed with laterite stone that was brought from <b>Bassein</b> which is 300km away from Goa. Since the laterite stone gets stronger with time, a Portuguese conservationist removed the lime plaster that was done on the outer walls of the church. Currently it seems that the walls are deteriorating.</p>
<h2>Mausoleum of Saint Francis Xavier</h2>
<p>Mausoleum of Saint Francis Xavier is here. There is a silver casket on top of it in which body of the saint is kept. <b>Giovanni Battista Foggini</b> was the architect and designer of the mausoleum and it took around ten years to complete its construction. The mausoleum was constructed on a base of Jasper which is red and purple coloured and has been adorned with marble.</p>
