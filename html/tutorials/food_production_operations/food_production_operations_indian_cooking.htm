<p style="text-align:right"><i>Indian food is like classical music raga - it takes time to build up to a crescendo.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:right"><i>… Shobhaa De, Indian Model and Author.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indian cuisine boasts about the widest variety of tastes, exotic aromas, and preparation methods. Being a country of diverse culture, the taste and preparation of food changes every few hundred kilometers along with the language dialects.</p>
<p>North Indian food is completely different in terms of look, flavor, and taste from South Indian food. Similarly, East-Indian food is totally different in its form than the food from West-Indian lands. Indian cuisine is recognized as part of different regions such as <i>Asamese, Andhrite, Bengali, Gujrati, Kashmiri, Marathi, Punjabi, South Indian,</i> and many more.</p>
<h2>Widely Used Ingredients in Indian Cuisine</h2>
<p>There are some special ingredients that an Indian kitchen stocks. The stock includes some gourmet dairy products such as <i>Ghee</i> and <i>Paneer</i>. These two dairy products are used in preparing sweets as well as savory dishes.</p>
<h3>Ghee</h3>
<p>Ghee is nothing but clarified butter, which is superior to the ordinary butter in terms of contents and flavor. The procedure of preparing this dairy product is little lengthy but the efforts and time spent on their preparation are worth the aroma and body they deliver to the food. The procedure goes as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Accumulate 8 parts of full cream of milk in a large deep pan.</p></li>
<li><p>Add 2 parts of thick sour curds and mix well and keep aside for 4 to 5 hours.</p></li>
<li><p>When the entire cream turns sour, beat it with the electric beater for around 20 minutes using water as required. This action separates butter and white buttermilk. The buttermilk is used in preparing a savory dish called <i>Kadhi</i>. It can be consumed as an appetizer too.</p></li>
<li><p>Take out butter in a heavy bottom pan.</p></li>
<li><p>Heat it on low flame till you get to see brownish golden burnt milk solids deposited at the bottom of the pan and a transparent golden ghee on the top of it.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Paneer</h3>
<p>This is a basic ingredient of Paneer based gravies and desserts.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Boil 2 liters milk in a deep pan.</p></li>
<li><p>When it is coming to full boil, add 2 to 3 tbsp vinegar into it.</p></li>
<li><p>Stir for a while occasionally.<p></li>
<li><p>Boil for a few minutes further till you get to see milk chunks separated from thin white whey.</p></li>
<li><p>Place a clean cotton cloth with edges spread outwards in another deep pan.</p></li>
<li><p>Put water separated milk solids into the cloth.</p></li>
<li><p>Assemble the edges of cloth to drain the whey completely and you get <i>Paneer</i>.</p></li>
<li><p>Cut into pieces of desired shape and store in the freezer.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Some other important ingredients kept handy are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">

</ul>
<h2>Importance of Chhonk in Indian Cuisine</h2>
<p>Chhonk (popularly known as <i>Tadka</i>) is a cooking method by which aroma of various spices extracted and incorporated in the food. Five main ingredients are put in chhonk by heating oil in a pan: Mustard seeds, cumin seeds, asafoetida, turmeric powder, and curry leaves.</p>
<p>Sometimes finely chopped green chili or garlic, juliennes of ginger, ginger-garlic paste, fennel seeds, or red chili powder, is added to release their aroma. These ingredients can vary according to the cuisine.</p>
