<h1>SAP MM - Overview</h1>
<p>SAP ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) is a commercial software that integrates all the information in a single software, considering various factors such as time and cost. Organizations can easily meet their business demands with the help of SAP.</p>
<h2>SAP Business Process</h2>
<p>SAP MM is the short form for SAP Material Management system. The roles of SAP MM in a business process are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A business process in SAP is termed as a “module”.</p></li>
<li><p>SAP MM is a part of logistics functions and it helps in managing the procurement activities of an organization.</p></li>
<li><p>It supports all aspects of material management (planning, control, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>It is the backbone of logistics that incorporates modules such as Sales and Distribution, Production Planning, Plant Maintenance, Project Systems, and Warehouse Management.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Features of SAP MM</h2>
<p>The features of a SAP MM system are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>SAP MM is one of the modules of SAP that deals with material management and inventory management.</p></li>
<li><p>Material Management as a process ensures no shortage of materials or any gaps in the supply chain process of the organization. SAP MM speeds up the procurement and material management activities, making the business run smoothly with complete time and cost efficiency.</p></li>
<li><p>It deals with managing the materials (products and/or services) and resources of an organization with the aim of accelerating productivity and reducing costs. At the same time, SAP MM is quite versatile to accommodate changes that are frequent in any business environment.</p></li>
<li><p>It deals with the Procurement Process, Master Data (Material &amp; Vendor Master), Account Determination &amp; Valuation of Material, Inventory Management, Invoice Verification, Material Requirement Planning, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>SAP MM - Screen Navigation</h1>
<p>The first step to understand SAP is to have a basic knowledge of its various screens. The following sections describe how to navigate through the screens available in SAP and how to use the functionalities of the standard toolbar.</p>
<h2>Login Screen</h2>
<p>Log on to the SAP ERP server. The SAP login screen will prompt you for the User ID and the Password. Provide a valid user ID and password and press enter. The user id and password are provided by the system administrator. The login screen appears as follows &minus;</p>
<img src="/sap_mm/images/login.png" alt="SAP Login" />
<h2>Standard Toolbar Icon</h2>
<p>The following screenshot shows the toolbars available on the SAP screen. &minus;</p>
<img src="/sap_mm/images/toolbar.png" alt="SAP Toolbar" />
<p>Given below is a brief description of the available toolbars &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Menu Bar</b> &minus; Menu bar is the topline of the dialog window in the SAP system.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Standard Toolbar</b> &minus; This toolbar includes standard functions such as save, top of page, end of page, page up, page down, print, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Title Bar</b> &minus; Title bar displays the name of the application/business process you are currently in.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Application Toolbar</b> &minus; Application-specific menu options are available on this toolbar.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Command Field</b> &minus; To start a business application without navigating through menu transactions, some logical codes are assigned to the business processes. Transaction codes are entered in the command field to start an application directly.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Standard Exit Keys</h2>
<p>Exit keys are used to exit the module or to log off. They are used to go back to the last accessed screen. The following screenshot highlights the standard exit keys used in SAP &minus;</p>
<img src="/sap_mm/images/exit_keys.png" alt="SAP Exit Keys" />
<h3>New Session Icon</h3>
<p>For creating a new session, we use the following keys shown in the screenshot below &minus;</p>
<img src="/sap_mm/images/new_session.png" alt="SAP New Session" />
<h3>Log Off</h3>
<p>It is a good practice to log off from the SAP system when you finish your work. There are several ways to log off from the system, but it can be done using the following instructions as shown in the screenshot below &minus;</p>
<img src="/sap_mm/images/log_off.png" alt="SAP Log Off" />
<h1>SAP MM - Procurement Process</h1>
<p>Every organization acquires material or services to complete its business needs. The process of buying materials and obtaining services from vendors or dealers is called procurement. Procurement should be done in such a way that materials are ordered in correct quantity, with a proper value at the proper time. It is subdivided into following parts &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Basic Procurement</li>
<li>Special Procurement</li>
</ul>
<h2>Basic Procurement</h2>
<p>Basic procurement is a process of acquiring goods or services in the right quantity, at the right price, and at the right time. However it is critical to maintain a right balance between quantity, price, and time. Consider the following example &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Organizations try and keep inventory levels at a minimum, due to the prices associated with high levels of inventory; at the same time, it can be detrimental to stop production due to shortage of raw materials.</p></li>
<li><p>Getting the minimum price for a product or service is often necessary, however it is equally important to maintain a balance between the product availability, quality, and vendor (seller) relations.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Procurement Lifecycle</h3>
<p>Procurement in most modern organizations follow some sequential steps which are described below &minus;</p>
<h3>Requirement and Information Gathering</h3>
<p>Procurement process starts with gathering information about a product and its quantity. Then for the required products and services, it is necessary to look for suppliers who can satisfy the requirements.</p>
<h3>Supplier Contact</h3>
<p>After gathering the requirements, one looks for the suppliers who can fulfill those requirements. Based on that, quotation requests or information requests are sent to the suppliers or they are contacted directly.</p>
<h3>Background Review</h3>
<p>Once the supplier is known, the product/service quality is checked, and any necessities for services such as installation, warranty, and maintenance parameters are investigated. Some samples of the products can be obtained for quality examination.</p>
<h3>Negotiation</h3>
<p>Some negotiations with suppliers is made regarding the price, availability, and delivery schedule of the products/services. Thereafter, a contract is signed that is a binding legal document between the supplier and the ordering party. A contract will include all necessary information such as price and quantity of material, delivery date, etc.</p>
<h3>Order Fulfillment</h3>
<p>Ordered material is shipped, delivered to the ordering party, and the supplier is paid accordingly. Training and installation of product or services may also be included.</p>
<h3>Consumption, Maintenance and Disposal</h3>
<p>As the products/services are consumed, the performance of the products or services is evaluated and any follow-up service support, if required, is analyzed.</p>
<h3>Contract Renewal</h3>
<p>Once the products or services are consumed or the contract expires and needs to be renewed, or the product or service is to be re-ordered, the experience with the vendors and service providers is reviewed. If the products or services are to be re-ordered, the company decides whether to order from the previous supplier or think about new suppliers.</p>
<h2>Basic Procurement Activities</h2>
<p>The following figure illustrates the flow of basic procurement activities &minus;</p>
<img src="/sap_mm/images/basic_procurement.png" alt="SAP Basic Procurement" />
<p>A brief introduction of the procurement activities is given below &minus;</p>

<h3>Type of Basic Procurement</h3>
<p>There are two types of basic procurement &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Procurement for Stock vs Consumption</p></li>
<li><p>External vs Internal Procurement </p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Procurement for Stock vs Consumption</h3>
<p>The following points show the difference of Procurement for Stock vs. Consumption &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Procurement for Stock</b> &minus; A stock material is a material that is kept in stock. These materials are kept in stock once received from the vendor. The stock of this material keeps on increasing or decreasing based on the amount of quantity received or issued. To order a material for stock, the material <b>must</b> have a master record within the system.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Procurement for Direct Consumption</b> &minus; When the procurement is for direct consumption, i.e., it will be consumed as soon as it is received, the user should specify the consumption purpose. To order a material for consumption, the material <b>may</b> have a master record within the system.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>External vs Internal Procurement</h3>
<p>The following points show the difference of External vs Internal Procurement &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>External procurement</b> &minus; It is the process of procuring goods or services from external vendors. There are three basic forms of external procurement generally supported by the purchasing component of the IT system.</p></li>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>One-time orders</b> are generally used for material and services that are ordered irregularly.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Longer-term contracts with the subsequent issue of release orders</b> &minus; For materials that are being ordered regularly and in large quantities, we can negotiate deal with the vendor (seller) for pricing or conditions & record then in a contract. In a contract you also specify the validity date.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Longer-term scheduling agreements and delivery schedules</b> &minus; If a material is ordered on an everyday basis and is to be delivered according to an exact time schedule, then you set up a scheduling agreement.</p></li>
</ul>
<li><p><b>Internal Procurement</b> &minus; Large corporate organizations may own multiple separate businesses or companies. Internal Procurement is process of getting material and services from among identical company. So, each of these companies maintains a complete bookkeeping system with separate Balance, Profit & Loss Statements so that when trade occurs between them it will be recorded.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Special Procurement</h2>
<p>Special stocks are the stocks that are managed differently, as these stocks do not belong to the company. Special stocks are kept at some particular location. Special procurement and special stock types are divided into the following categories &minus;</p>
<h3>Consignment Stocks</h3>
<p>Consignment stocks are those material that is available at our store premises, however it still belongs to the vendor (seller) of the material. If you utilize the material from consignment stocks, then you have to pay to the vendor.</p>
<h3>Third-party Processing</h3>
<p>In third-party processing, a company passes on a sales order to the associate external vendor (seller) who sends the goods directly to the customer. The sales order is not processed by the company, but by the vendor (seller). Third-party items can be entered in purchase requisitions, purchase orders, and sales orders.</p>
<h3>Pipeline Handling</h3>
<p>In pipeline handling, the company need not order or store the material involved. It is obtainable as and when required via a pipeline (for example, oil or water), or another style of cable (such as electricity). The material that is consumed is settled with the vendor (seller) on a regular basis.</p>
<h3>Returnable Transport Stock</h3>
<p>The company orders goods from a vendor (seller). The goods are delivered with returnable transport packaging (pallets, containers) that belongs to the vendor (seller) and is stored at the customer premises until they return it to the company.</p>
<h3>Subcontracting</h3>
<p>The vendor (the subcontractor) receives components from the ordering party with the help of which it produces a product. The product is ordered by your company through a purchase order. The components required by the vendor (seller) to manufacture the ordered product are listed in the purchase order and provided to the subcontractor.</p>
<h3>Stock Transfer Using Stock Transport Order</h3>
<p>Goods are procured and supplied within a company. One plant orders the goods internally from another plant (receiving plant/issuing plant). The goods are procured with a special type of purchase order – the stock transport order. You'll be able to request and monitor the transfer of goods with a stock transport order.</p>
<h1>SAP MM - Organization Structure</h1>
<p>Organization structure is the framework of a company according to which business is conducted in every company. Organization structure consists of many levels having direct or indirect relationship with one another. Organization structure is also referred as enterprise structure. Enterprise structure is made up of many organizational units having relationship with one another.</p>
<h2>SAP Implementation Guide</h2>
<p>When a client purchases SAP, it comes in a CD in the form of a software. When SAP is first installed, it has its standard setup that needs to be configured according to the needs of the client, i.e., organization.</p>
<p>Configuration of SAP is done with the help of an implementation guide, known as IMG. It is used to add fields, to change field names, to modify dropdown lists, etc. to adjust according to the functionality of an organization. IMG is where we define the enterprise structure and other settings that are required for the functioning of SAP according to the requirements of an organization.</p>
<h2>SAP IMG Path</h2>
<p>To perform any type of configuration according to the requirements of an organization, the first step is to reach the implementation guide (IMG) screen. We can reach the implementation guide in two ways &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Menu path</li>
<li>Transactional code</li>
</ul>

<h1>SAP MM - Organizational Units</h1>
<p>All the organizational units combined together form the framework of a company. These organizational units can be considered as different levels that describe the structure of an enterprise. Every level has a particular functionality associated with it. Also, every level in one or the other way is related to each other. These levels are placed according to some hierarchy, Company being at the top.</p>
<p>To establish a relationship between these levels, we have to assign them to one or other in such a way that they still lie in the same hierarchy. For example: As Company is at the top level and plant is below it, it is necessary that the plant has some relation with the company. As the plant is a sub-part or a smaller division of the company, it will be assigned to the company. A standard SAP has the following four basic and essential assignments &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Plant to company code</li>
<li>Purchasing organization to company code</li>
<li>Purchasing organization to plant</li>
<li>Standard purchasing organization to plant</li>

<h1>SAP MM - Master Data</h1>
<p>SAP R/3 works on real-time data, i.e., there is no time lag between data entry and data availability. The important thing while creating any data is to maintain data integrity. SAP R/3 data is categorized into two &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Master data</b> &minus; Data that is created centrally, and is valid for all applications. It remains constant over time but we need to update it on a regular basis. For example: Vendor is a type of master data that is used for creating purchase orders or contracts.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Transactional data</b> &minus; Data that is associated with processing of business transaction is transactional data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>SAP Master Data is of the following two types &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Material Master Data</p></li>
<li><p>Vendor Master Data</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Material Master Data</h2>
<p>The key points to note about material master data are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>This is the enterprise main source of material-specific data. This data will include information on the materials that a company can procure, produce, store, or sell.</p></li>
<li><p>Since there are different departments in an enterprise and each department works on some specific material, they will enter different information regarding their material. So, each user department has its own view of the material master record. The data screens that are used to create material master can be divided into two categories &minus;</p></li>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Main Data</b> &minus; This will include basic data (base unit of measure, weight), purchasing data (over tolerance and under tolerance), accounting data (standard price, moving price).</p></li>
<li><p><b>Additional Data</b> &minus; This will include additional information like short description about material, currency etc.</p></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Material master has four characteristics, which we will discuss one by one in the following sections.</p>
<h3>Material Types</h3>
<p>Materials with some common attributes are grouped together and they are assigned to a material type. It differentiates the materials and allows organizations to manage different materials in a systematic manner in accordance to a company’s requirement. For example, raw material and finished products are some of the material types. Material type can be created by following the steps given below.</p>

<h3>Number Range</h3>
<p>When we create a material master record, every material is recognized by a unique number that is known as the material number. We can assign a number to a material through two ways &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>External number assignment</b> &minus; While creating a material, you have to enter your own number (containing alphabets or digits), and that should be unique.</li>
<li><p><b>Internal number assignment</b> &minus; While creating a material, you need not enter any number. The system automatically generates a unique number to that material.</li>
</ul>

<h1>SAP MM - Procurement Cycle</h1>
<p>Every organization acquires material or services to complete its business needs. The process of buying materials and obtaining services from vendors or dealers is called procurement. The steps required to procure material forms the procurement cycle. Every organization performs some common sequential steps to procure material in the right quantity at the right price. The important steps in a procurement cycle are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Determination of Requirement</li>
<li>Creating Purchase Order</li>
<li>Posting Goods Receipt</li>

</ul>
<h2>Determination of Requirement</h2>
<p>This is the first step in a procurement cycle. It is the logical subdivision, where it is determined what material or services are required by the company, and which supplier can fulfill the requirement. A list of requirements is made and then it is approved by a senior authority within the organization. After approval, a formal list is made that is known as the purchase order with one more level of approval which is sent to the vendor.</p>
<h2>Creating Purchase Order</h2>
<p>Purchase order is the formal and final confirmation of the requirements that is sent to the vendor to supply material or services. A purchase order includes important information such as name of the material with its corresponding plant, details of purchasing organization with its company code, name of vendor, and date of delivery. A purchase order can be created by following the steps given below &minus;</p>

<h1>SAP MM - Quota Arrangement</h1>
<p>A particular material can be procured from different vendors depending upon the requirement. In this way, the total requirement of a material is distributed to different vendors, i.e., the quota is assigned to each source of supply. This is known as quota arrangement. The key points to note about quota arrangement are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Quota arrangement divides the total requirement of material among certain sources of supply, i.e. vendors, and then assigns a quota to each source.</p></li>
<li><p>This particular quota specifies the portion of material that is to be procured from an assigned vendor or source.</p></li>
<li><p>Quota rating is used to determine the amount of material that is to be assigned to a particular source or vendor. The source with the lowest quota rating represents a valid source.</p></li>
<li><p>Quota rating can be calculated by using the following formula &minus;</p>
<p>Quota rating = (Quota Allocated Quantity + Quota Base Quantity)/Quota</p>
<p>Where Quota Allocated Quantity is total quantity from all orders that is procured from a particular source. Quota Base Quantity is quantity from new source of supply. Quota is total requirement of material that is given to a particular source of supply.</p></li>
<li><p>The mandatory setting before creating a quota is that the info record and the source list should be maintained for the particular material. Also, in the material master, the source list and quota arrangement usage check boxes should be checked. This setting can be made in the material master by going to TCode MM03. In purchasing view, check the quota arrangement usage and the source list. Setting is now maintained for quota arrangement.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>SAP MM - Posting Period</h1>
<p>SAP ERP systems were designed so that business can be conducted in an efficient way. Documents such as purchase order, request for quotation, goods receipt are essential elements in a business. These documents need security, i.e., if any of the documents is posted incorrectly, then the business can get affected at various levels. In order to secure these documents, we have a concept known as the <b>posting period</b>.</p>
<p>A posting period allows one to post and make changes in the documents only in a specific time period. Sometimes you will get errors like “posting allowed only in this time period for a certain company code”. It means for a particular company code, a posting period is maintained and posting to that document is only allowed within that period. A posting period for a company can be defined using five fields which are as follows &minus;</p>

<h1>SAP MM - Purchase Order Types</h1>
<p>SAP ERP was introduced so that procurement can be done efficiently in terms of time and cost. Procurement can be done for various types of goods and services. Procurement starts with creating a purchase order, i.e., a formal document given to vendors and it includes a list of goods and materials that are to be procured. Accordingly, purchase orders can be created for different types of procurement. The type of procurement can be maintained in a field that is known as <b>item category</b> as shown below.</p>
<img src="/sap_mm/images/purchase_item_category.png" alt="SAP purchase item category" />
<p>For different procurement types, there are four types of purchase orders, which are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Subcontracting Purchase Order</li>
<li>Consignment Purchase Order</li>
<li>Stock Transfer Purchase Order</li>
<li>Service Purchase Order</li>
</ul>

<h1>SAP MM - Inventory Management</h1>
<p>Procurement process starts with gathering requirements and ends with procuring goods from vendors. Once the goods are procured from a vendor, they need to be placed in the company’s premises in correct place so that they can be consumed when required. Inventory management deals with placing and handling the stock received from the vendors in correct place within the company’s premises. &minus;</p>
<p>Listed below are the points to note about inventory management &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Inventory management deals with the management of stock, either on value or quantity basis.</p></li>
<li><p>It includes planning, entry, and keeping records of all the movements of goods.</p></li>
<li><p>Goods movement creates a document that updates all the stock quantity and value in the inventory that is known as the <b>material document</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>A material document is referred by a document number and document year.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>One normally comes across the following terms while doing inventory management &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Movement Type</li>
<li>Goods Receipt</li>
<li>Reservation</li>
<li>Goods Issue</li>
</ul>
<h2>Movement Type</h2>
<p>Movement type describes the type of stock posting in inventory. It represents whether the posting in stock is against goods receipt or goods issue. The important movement types in SAP MM are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>101 &minus; Goods receipt for purchase order or order.</p></li>
<li><p>103 &minus; Goods receipt for purchase order into GR blocked stock.</p></li>

<h1>SAP MM - Invoice Verification</h1>
<p>Every organization acquires goods or services to complete its business needs. Once goods are procured from a vendor and placed in company’s premises through goods receipt, we need to pay to the vendor for the acquired goods and services. The amount to be paid along with the details of the material is provided by the vendor in the form of a document that is known as the <b>invoice</b>. Before paying to the vendor, we need to verify the invoice. This process of verifying the invoice before making a payment is known as <b>invoice verification</b>. The key points to note about invoice verification are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Invoice verification marks the end of procurement, after purchase order and goods receipt.</p></li>
<li><p>Invoice posting updates all the related documents in financials and accounting.</p></li>
<li><p>Blocked invoice that vary from actual invoice can be processed through invoice verification.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>One normally comes across the following terms in invoice verification &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Posting of Invoice</li>
<li>Blocked Invoice</li> 
<li>Evaluated Receipt Settlement(ERS)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Posting of Invoice</h2>
<p>Posting of invoice is done after having received the goods from the vendor and after having completed the goods receipt. The invoice received from a vendor is verified against cost, quantity, and quality by the ordering party, and then the invoice is posted against that purchase order.</p> 
<p>This is the phase where the vendor (seller) is paid from the company and reconciliation of the invoice and PO is accomplished. Follow the steps given below to post an invoice.</p>
<h3>Path to Post Invoice</h3>
<p>Logistics &rArr; Materials Management &rArr; Logistic Invoice Verification &rArr; Document Entry &rArr; Enter Invoice</p>
<p>TCode: MIRO</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; On the SAP Menu screen, select Enter Invoice by following the above path.</p>
<img src="/sap_mm/images/post_invoice.png" alt="SAP post invoice" />
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Fill in all the necessary details such as invoice posting date, amount that is paid to the vendor along with the quantity for which the amount is paid. Click on Save. Invoice is now posted for the goods receipt.</p>
<img src="/sap_mm/images/post_invoice_entry.png" alt="SAP post invoice entry" />
<h2>Blocked Invoice</h2>
<p>Sometimes the accounting department may not be able to pay a vendor as per the invoice raised. This may happen in the following scenario. You try to post an invoice, however the system expects certain default value against the purchase order or the goods receipt and the posted invoice differs from the default value. This may lead to invoice blocking. Invoice blocking is caused due to &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Variance in amount at item level</p></li>
<li><p>Variance in quantity at item level</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is difficult to analyze small variances in invoice. So, tolerance limits are set up in the system and if the variance in the invoice is within the tolerance limit, then the system accepts the invoice. If the variance exceeds the tolerance limit, then it may lead to invoice blocking. In such cases, we need to manually unblock or release the blocked invoice if it has to be processed. Follow the steps given below to unblock an invoice.</p>
<h3>Path to Release Blocked Invoice</h3>
<p>Logistics &rArr; Materials Management &rArr; Logistic Invoice verification &rArr; Further Processing &rArr; Release Blocked Invoice</p>
<p>TCode: MRBR</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; On the SAP Menu screen, select Release Blocked Invoices by following the above path.</p>
<img src="/sap_mm/images/release_block.png" alt="SAP release block invoice" />
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Provide necessary details such as company code, invoice document number, vendor, posting date, and purchasing group. Then click the execute button. The blocked invoice will be released.</p>
<img src="/sap_mm/images/release_block_entry.png" alt="SAP release block invoice entry" />
<h2>Evaluated Receipt Settlement</h2>
<p>Evaluated Receipt Settlement (ERS) is an easy method of settling goods receipt automatically. If the ordering party has agreed with the vendor on all financial terms and condition, then it need not verify the invoice. Invoice will be posted automatically from the information present in the purchase order and the goods receipt. Given below are the advantages of having an ERS &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Purchase orders can be settled and closed quickly.</p></li>
<li><p>It reduces human efforts, as there is no need to verify the invoice.</p></li>
<li><p>Amount and quantity variances in invoice can be avoided with the help of ERS.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To implement ERS, some mandatory settings are to be done in the vendor master.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Go to XK02 (Change mode of vendor master).</p></li>
<li><p>Select Control data tab.</p></li>
<li><p>Check the AutoEvalGRSetmt Del. and AutoEvalGRSetmt Ret box.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on Save. Now the particular vendor is enabled for ERS.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/sap_mm/images/setting_ers.png" alt="SAP Setting for ERS" />
<p>Follow the steps given below to create an ERS.</p>
<h3>Path to Create ERS</h3>
<p>Logistics &rArr; Materials Management &rArr; Logistic Invoice verification &rArr; Automatic Settlement &rArr; Evaluated Receipt Settlement (ERS)</p> 
<p>TCode: MRRL</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; On the SAP Menu screen, select Evaluated Receipt Settlement (ERS) by following the above path.</p>
<img src="/sap_mm/images/ers_path.png" alt="SAP ERS path" />

<img src="/sap_mm/images/ers_entry.png" alt="SAP ERS entry" />
<h1>SAP MM - Service Management</h1>
<p>Besides procurement of goods, an organization may occasionally require some kind of services. Such services include small maintenance tasks such as changing the lights, painting, and housekeeping. These services are carried out by external contractors and hence the whole process of procurement of services is known as service management. The key points to note about service management are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Services are meant for direct consumption instead of keeping them in inventory.</p></li>
<li><p>Service description along with its unit of measure is stored as master data in a record that is known as the <b>service master record.</b></p></li>
<li><p>The system stores the services that have been procured as a record in a sheet that is called as the service entry sheet.</p></li>
<li><p>Service procurement can be of the following two types&minus;</p></li>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Planned Services</b> &minus; In planned services at the time of procurement specifications like quantity and price are known in advance. It means nature and scope of service is clear before procurement.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Unplanned Services</b> &minus; In unplanned services at the time of procurement specifications like quantity and price are not known in advance. It means nature and scope of service is not clear before procurement. These services can be extended as per the requirement.</p></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Service management deals with the following terms&minus;</p>

<h1>SAP MM - Valuation</h1>
<p>Procurement process starts with creating a purchase order and ends with invoice verification. In the whole process, one of the important parts is material valuation. While creating purchase orders, material price is a mandatory field and it is automatically determined. It happens because material valuation is maintained in the SAP system in the material master. Material valuation represents integration between MM &amp; FI (Financial Accounting) modules, since it updates the general ledger accounts in financial accounting. The key points to note about material valuation are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Material valuation helps in determining the price of the material, and in which general ledger account it needs to be posted.</p></li>
<li><p>Material valuation can happen at company code level or plant level.</p></li>
<li><p>Material can be valuated based on different types of procurement; it is known as <b>split valuation</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Split Valuation</h2>
<p>Split valuation helps in valuating the stocks of a material in the same valuation area (company or plant) differently. Some of the examples where split valuation is required are as follows&minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Stock that is procured externally from a vendor has a different valuation price than the stock of an in-house production.</p></li>
<li><p>Stock obtained from one vendor is valuated at a different price than the stock obtained from another vendor.</p></li>
<li><p>Same material having different batch may have different valuation prices.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Split Valuation needs to be activated before setting any other configuration. Follow the steps given below to activate split valuation.</p>
<h3>Path to Activate Split Valuation</h3>
<p>IMG &rArr; Materials Management &rArr; Valuation and Account Assignment &rArr; Split Valuation &rArr; Activate Split Valuation</p>
<p>TCode: OMW0</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; On the Display IMG screen, select Activate Split Valuation by following the above path.</p>
<img src="/sap_mm/images/split_valuation.png" alt="SAP Split Valuation" />
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Click the option Split Material Valuation Active. Click on Save. Split valuation is now activated.</p>
<img src="/sap_mm/images/split_valuation_set.png" alt="SAP Split Valuation Set" />
<p>Some important terms under split valuation are as follows.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Valuation Area</b> &minus; Material may be valuated at plant level or at company code level. The level at which materials are valuated is known as valuation area.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Valuation Category</b> &minus; Valuation category is the criteria on which material is split valuated.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Valuation Type</b> &minus; Valuation type specifies the features of a valuation category.</p></li>
</ul>
<!-- <p>Split valuation configurations like defining valuation category, valuation type are described in below context.</p> -->

<h1>SAP MM - Account Determination</h1>
<p>In SAP MM, procurement process involves the cost of goods and services that needs to be paid to the vendor by an organization. The cost being paid must be posted in an organization necessarily in a correct general ledger (G/L) account. It is quite impossible to recollect and feed the correct G/L account every time during procurement. To avoid this inconvenience, the SAP system can be configured so that the system will automatically determine the correct G/L account that needs to be posted. G/L account is posted when goods receipt is done as well as during clearing the invoice verification. Account determination deals with the following terms&minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Define Valuation Control</li>
<li>Group together Valuation Areas</li>
<li>Define Valuation Classes</li>
<li>Configure Automatic Posting</li>
</ul>
<h2>Define Valuation Control</h2>
<p>Valuation areas can be grouped together and can be assigned to one grouping code, if they belong to the same G/L account. For example, different plants under one company code can be assigned the same valuation grouping code and vice versa. Before this, valuation grouping code must be activated and this can be done by following the steps given below.</p>
