<li><p>Product Planning is the activity where Product Owners identify, organize and groom the Backlog to prepare it. The development/testing/BA team(s) works on this aspect. If planning does not happen properly, sprint works affect the productivity and timeline of project..</p></li>
<li><p>It involves managing the backlog items, test sets and defects that define the updates going into the product.</p></li>
<li><p>These items form the backlog and are ranked by priority so they can be scheduled into releases/projects and sprints.</p></li>
<li><p>Product Planner is divided into two sections – Planning and Input. The Planning section consists of &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p><b>Backlog</b> &minus; It is used for planning and prioritization of Agile backlog in list view.</p></li>

<h1>VersionOne - Edit Story</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will learn how to edit story in VersionOne. Editing a story consists of many actions. With the Edit Story feature, we can modify the details of the story, close it, delete it, add it into the watchlist, block it with issues or defects, convert into defect, etc. In this chapter, we will discuss how to go about editing story details, closing a story and deleting a story.</p>
<h2>Edit Story Details</h2>
<p>While editing the story details, a user can edit the details of the story including title, priority, estimation and dependencies. The only field that remains unmodified is the unique id of the story; it can never be changed or modified.</p>

<h1>VersionOne - Defects</h1>
<p>In STLC, a user can create defects to plan and track fixes. Defects are work items of the Backlog. Similar to stories/backlog items, a user can estimate points to defects that factor into the team's velocity. A user can break it into tasks and acceptance tests to allocate the work required to complete and deliver it.</p>
<p>Defects are flagged as red symbol to identify and differentiate from other backlog items.</p>
<h2>Add a Defect</h2>
<p>Defect can be added by all the team members having project access. There are many ways to log a defect into VersionOne. In this chapter, we will discuss how to add a defect.</p>

<h1>VersionOne - Edit Defects</h1>
<p>Editing a defect involves many actions. The different actions can be - modifying details of the defect, closing it, deleting it, add into the watch list, block it with issues or another defects, convert into story etc. In this chapter, we will discuss how to go about editing defect details, closing a defect and deleting a defect.</p>
<h2>Edit Defect Details</h2>
<p>While editing the defect details, a user can edit all the details of the defect including title, priority, estimation and dependencies. The only unmodified field is unique id of the defect, it can never change or modify.</p>
<p>There are three ways to edit a defect. The ways will be discussed as options below &minus;</p>
<h3>Option 1</h3>
<p>The steps in this option are recommended to quickly edit the title, estimated points, projects, priority, owner and order.</p>

<h2>Close a Defect</h2>
<p>Once all the tasks of a defect are completed, it can be closed to claim the work done in the sprint. A closed defect can be re-opened later if required. In this section, we will discuss how to close a defect.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Closing a defect tells that all the work related to it is completed and that the fixes are done.</p></li>
<li><p>Once a defect is closed, a user can re-open it if the same bug appears again.</p></li>
<li><p>Quick close update the status of defect and closes it in a single click.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are many ways to close a defect. The ways will be discussed as options below.</p>

<li><p>If a user selects Close, it opens an additional window. Here, select a status and click on Close Defect.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Delete a Defect</h2>
<p>A deleted defect cannot be tracked and visualized later. Deletion usually happens if a defect is not needed or if it is duplicate. In this section, we will discuss the deletion of a defect.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>If a defect is created in error or duplicate, then only it should be deleted. For tracking the defect, it must be closed instead of getting deleted.</p></li>
<li><p>Deleting a defect hides all of its references.</p></li>
<li><p>If a defect is deleted, all its child items such as link, attachments, task or test sets are also deleted.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let us now see the different steps involved to delete a story &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Go to Product Planner &rarr; Backlog.</p></li>

<h1>VersionOne - Release Planner</h1>
<p>Release Planning is an optional activity. In this planning, the development team schedules the work items to be delivered in a release, also called a project. As part of the effort, team estimates and prioritizes the backlog items and then breaks them down into a series of sprints/iterations.</p>
<p>In general, there are two types of release planning &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Tactical release planning is done at the backlog level. It schedules individual backlog items, defects or test sets for incorporation in a release.</p></li>
<li><p>Strategic release planning is done at the feature level. It schedules the entire portfolio items which automatically brings along the lower level backlog items. To drive strategic plans, a team can use factors such as business value, risk, team velocity, and cost (swag at the portfolio item level or Estimate at the backlog item level).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Release Planner consists of Planning and Tracking activities. The planning activities group Release scheduling, Regression Planning and Team Scheduling while the tracking activities group Release Forecasting, Program Board and Delivery at a glance.</p>
<p>The Release Planner and its activities can be accessed by clicking on the Release Planner as shown in the screenshot below &minus;</p>
<img src="/versionone/images/release.jpg" alt="Release" />
<h2>Release Scheduling</h2>
<p>Release scheduling is part of Release Planning. In this scheduling, release is scheduled for the project. A project can have multiple releases and in this stage, all releases are scheduled like when a release will go live and when all the release related works will be completed.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The Lifecycle Release Scheduling feature is an optional release planning tool. It allows to build a release plan by scheduling stories/backlog items or portfolio items into releases.</p></li>
<li><p>Release schedules an end date of release as well.</p></li>
<li><p>To access Release Scheduling, from the main menu, select Release Planner &rarr; Release Scheduling.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following screenshot displays the Release Scheduling page &minus;</p>
<img src="/versionone/images/stats.jpg" alt="Stats" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The items in the backlog grid on the left are "unscheduled". In other words, they have not been added to a project/release.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that once "scheduled", the work item is removed and no longer displays in the backlog grid on the right.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/versionone/images/child_projects.jpg" alt="Child Projects" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>To add a backlog item into release, a user can drag and drop into Child Projects &rarr; &lt;Release Name&gt; at the left side as shown in the screenshot below &minus;</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Team Scheduling</h2>
<p>Time Scheduling defines the timeline of the releases and completion as well as the start date of other backlog items. Timeline is the standard reference to re-distribute work items and resource allocation in the project.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Team Scheduling allows the user to allocate and view workload across assigned teams working on selected projects/releases.</p></li>
<li><p>In Agile, backlog is assigned to the team, not to individual team members.</p></li>
<li><p>Team Scheduling displays how workload is distributed across teams and the capability to redistribute the work based on needs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following screenshot displays the Team Scheduling page &minus;</p>
<img src="/versionone/images/add_item.jpg" alt="Add Item" />
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; The Team Scheduling feature is being deprecated in favor of new Iteration/Sprint Scheduling page.</p>
<h2>Release Forecasting</h2>
<p>Release Forecasting provides analyzed data based on the end dates. It also provides analyzed velocity of the team to achieve targets at various ends dates. It is basically forecasting of the entire project from high level to the granular level with respect to different target dates. Following are a few important features of Release Forecasting &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Release forecasting report simultaneously shows the forecasted end dates. This is based on optimistic, pessimistic and average velocity.</p></li>
<li><p>These velocity values are calculated from the visible historical data.</p></li>
<li><p>It also indicates the end date of the selected project; with this, a user can compare the forecasted dates to the planned end date.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition, a user can forecast the end dates based on total estimate or workitems count.</p></li>
<li><p>Release Forecasting can be accessed by navigating Release Planner &rarr; Release Forecasting.</p></li>
<li><p>After the selection of report fields, click on Go. It displays the forecasting report.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following screenshot displays Release Forecasting &minus;</p>

<h1>VersionOne - Sprint Planning</h1>
<p>Sprint Planning is also known as Iteration Planning. In this planning, agile team identifies the features to be worked on during a sprint. A planning meeting takes place at the beginning of every sprint. The team discusses the highest remaining prioritized backlog items and breaks them down into specific tasks and tests. Team also estimates the effort to complete them. Velocity and the teams past performance are used to determine the amount of work the team schedules into the sprint and commits to. Team members typically sign up for initial tasks during the meeting and later pick up additional tasks if time permits during the sprint.</p>
<p>Sprint Planning is based on three pillars &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Sprint Scheduling</b> &minus; In this phase, the team pulls the work that can be delivered from prioritize backlog.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Detail Planning</b> &minus; Workitem lists in the sprint with all the associated tasks and tests.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Member Planning</b> &minus; Current sprint work rolled up per member; it is the average capacity planning.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These can be accessed by navigating Team Planner &rarr; (Under Sprint Planning) Sprint Scheduling/Detail Planning/Member Planning as shown in the screenshot below &minus;</p>
<img src="/versionone/images/team.jpg" alt="Team" />
<h1>VersionOne - Sprint Scheduling</h1>
<p>The first step in the Iteration/Sprint planning process Iteration/Sprint Scheduling. In this step, the team selects the amount of work it can deliver from the prioritized backlog. The Team makes use of the historical velocity as a guide reference to commit the work. This helps the team determine how much to schedule in each sprint.</p>
<p>To access Sprint Scheduling, from the main menu, select Team Planner &rarr; Sprint Scheduling.</p>
<h2>Add a Sprint</h2>
<p>It is the job of a Project Owner or Scrum Master to add a sprint. Sprint is added well before the start date and it clearly mentions the start and end dates to achieve the committed goals. Follow these steps to add a sprint into the project &minus;</p>

<h1>VersionOne - Task</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss what a task in VersionOne is. Tasks are related to the estimation in hours to achieve a backlog item. A backlog item can have any number of tasks to complete the item. It is a user’s responsibility to add all the tasks that need to be performed to complete the backlog item. All tasks should be added on day 1 of the sprint. However, tasks can be added and edited throughout the sprint if required.</p>
<h2>Add Task</h2>
<p>Task represents the work that is required to complete the backlog item. A user can add a task into backlog items such as story, defect, and test sets, etc.</p>

<h2>Rules for Excel File</h2>
<p>Every template has some basic rules/checkpoints to be considered before importing the data. If these checkpoints fail, data will not be imported and error message displays. In this section, we will discuss the excel rules &minus;</p>
<p>Consider the following points while creating an excel file &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The header of the first column should always be "AssetType". The column should have the system name for the asset type. The system names for basic asset types are included in the comments in the templates. For example, for story it should be Story, Defect for each Defect and Issue for each issue, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The attribute data for the new backlog item should go to the remaining columns. The column header should be the name of the attributes. The column should contain the corresponding attribute value for that asset.</p></li>
<li><p>Worksheets are imported into alphabetical order of worksheet name. In the same excel file, a user can reference a work item that was created in an earlier worksheet. For example, to create a project and stories within the project, first add the project in the first worksheet and then add the stories in the new project in a second worksheet.</p></li>
<li><p>The backlog import template includes system names for default assets and fields. To include other assets or fields, including custom fields, please contact system administrator for the corresponding system names. User can remove unnecessary fields by deleting the column.</p></li>
<li><p>To maintain data integrity, each Import is conducted within a single transaction. For this reason import is limiting to 500 items per import file.</p></li>
<li><p>In the advanced template, there are 7 worksheets to upload 7 different items in single transaction. The Epics, Stories, Tasks, Tests, Defects, Requests and Issues form the order of the worksheet.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Import Excel File</h2>
<p>Data can be imported into VersionOne using excel file. A user must check the checkpoints of the excel sheet before importing it. If the imports are successful, a user will get success message along with the imported count otherwise an error message displays.

<h1>VersionOne - Notification</h1>
<p>Notification is subscription based. Subscription allows controlling the types of notifications a user receives. It is based on the event types that a user subscribes to. For example, if a user wants to know when a work item is assigned to him, he can set up a subscription to notify. User can also subscribe when a story is closed or even when the status of a defect changes. This way, a user can keep track of the things.</p>
<h2>Subscription</h2>
<p>To get a notification, a user needs to subscribe to the notification service first. Until it is not subscribed, a user cannot receive any notification. In this section, we will discuss how to subscribe for a specific notification.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>To view the user’s subscription for notification, go to My Home &rarr; Subscription as shown below &minus;</p></li>
</ul>

<li><p>Now, click on the Subscribe button as shown below &minus;</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/versionone/images/subscribe.jpg" alt="My Subscriptions" />
<h2>Delete a Subscription</h2>
<p>Whenever a user wants to stop receive any notification, he should delete the notification at the subscription page. In this section, we will discuss how to delete a subscription.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>To delete a subscription, go to My Home &rarr; Subscription.</p></li>
<li><p>At My Subscription, click on the Edit dropdown at the right side.</p></li>

<h1>VersionOne - Estimably</h1>
<p>Estimably is an estimation game. It is a cloud based estimation game that is used to play with sprint team to estimate the backlog items collectively. It helps in estimation for both co-located and remote team members. It works as group collaboration and combined with independent voting. When the team reaches a decision, it can automatically update the backlog item’s estimate.</p>
<img src="/versionone/images/estimably.jpg" alt="Estimably" />
<p>Estimably can be accessed in the Team Room by navigating Product Planner &rarr; Team Room. Now, click on Estimably as shown in the screenshot below &minus;</p>
<h2>Start a Game</h2>
<p>There are some basic rules to play the estimation game. In this section, we will discuss how to start a game.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Only the facilitator should start a game by clicking on the Start a Game button.</p></li>
<li><p>The designated facilitator then communicates the URL and the Game ID to the participants.</p></li>
<li><p>The participants log in to the game using that information. When they do, they are visible to the facilitator.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following screenshot displays how to start a game &minus;</p>

</ul>
<img src="/versionone/images/join_game.jpg" alt="Join Game" />
<h2>Play the Game</h2>
<p>Once the game is started, all team members can play their part by choosing the estimation number. Here, facilitator plays an important role to start the round. Follow these steps to play the game.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The facilitator drags an un-estimated item from the Backlog panel into the game.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the Begin Round button; this allows all participants to see numbers to estimate the item as shown below &minus;</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/versionone/images/play_game.jpg" alt="Play Game" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>At this point, the Product Owner again describes the item and the acceptance criteria to provide a good understanding. The Team Members can ask questions if any for more clarity.</p></li>
<li><p>After that, the voting participants vote.</p></li>
<li><p>As the voting occurs, the facilitator can see who has voted. Each participant can see a running total of the number of votes.</p></li>
<li><p>When all participants have voted, the facilitator ends the voting round, which presents everyone the results as shown below &minus;</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/versionone/images/results.jpg" alt="Results" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>If there is agreement by all, then the facilitator simply submits the vote to save it to that work item and select another to estimate.</p></li>
<li><p>If there is some variation in the voting, the team members can discuss their reasoning. At this point, the facilitator can elect to run the vote again or can select a verbally agreed-upon value to submit as the estimate.</p></li>
<li><p>As soon as facilitator clicks on submit to workitem, the value gets updated as estimation into backlog item.</p></li>
