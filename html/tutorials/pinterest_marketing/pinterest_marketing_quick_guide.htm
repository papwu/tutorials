<h1>Digital Marketing - Introduction</h1>
<p>Today’s era of Internet has opened a gate of vast variety of opportunities for businesses. Using social networks, one cannot only share a private picture of one’s birthday but also earn customers for one’s business and reach them conveniently. The speed and ease with which the digital media transmits information and help boost a business is amazing.</p>
<p>Let us first throw some light on the scope of digital marketing.</p>
<h2>What is Digital Marketing?</h2>
<p>Digital Marketing is the term used for the targeted, measurable, and interactive marketing of products or services using digital technologies to reach the viewers, turn them into customers, and retain them.</p>
<p>So, how is digital marketing different from traditional marketing?</p>
<p>The traditional manner of marketing involved businesses to advertise their products or services on print media, radio and television commercials, business cards, bill boards, and in many other similar ways where Internet or social media websites were not employed for advertising. Traditional marketing policies had limited customer reachability and scope of driving customers’ buying behavior.</p>
<p>Digital marketing achieves targets of marketing a business through different online channels. Let us see how.</p>
<p>The following table lists a few points that differentiate digital marketing from traditional marketing &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center">Traditional Marketing</th>

<td style="vertical-align:middle">Communication is unidirectional. Means, a business communicates about its products or services with a group of people.</td>

<h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
<p>Social Media Marketing is the manner of generating website traffic or attracting viewers and customers through social networking websites such as Facebook, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Twitter, and so on. Social media marketing is a subset of digital marketing.</p>
<img src="/pinterest_marketing/images/social_media_marketing.jpg" alt="Social Media Marketing" />
<p>All social networking websites support sharing of content, but all are not necessarily employed for digital marketing. While Facebook emphasizes on personal sharing, Twitter emphasizes on tweeting short messages about ones’ opinions or reactions, and LinkedIn goes for professional networking, Pinterest motivates to market one’s ideas and online businesses.</p>
<h2>Principle of Social Media Marketing</h2>
<p>Social media grew up as the most popular outcome of the Internet as people around the world like to communicate and share their special moments, problems, ideas, and suggestions with others. They also like to learn about a place worth visiting, a new craft projects, recipes, or a new language. Social media websites enable you to share content of your choice with right audience at your convenience.</p>
<p>This popularity of social media has inspired the business minds around the world with the idea of small online businesses. One can open a store in Amazon, eBay, or any other custom platforms such as Shopify or Etsy. But the main challenge is finding the customers. There are ways like search results in Google, Bing or in any other search engine. But for a new business with established competitors, it takes a long time to get a high rank in the search results.</p>
<p>Social networking websites are a great solution to this challenge. The basic technique here is to share engaging posts and the right content created for the desired audience. Then the audience helps by sharing the content further, which in turn reaches further. Hence there is another option of advertising the product, services, or ideas on the social networking websites where there is less degree of competition.</p>
<p>This tutorial describes how you can employ Pinterest for marketing your business.</p>
<h1>Pinterest Marketing - Basics</h1>
<p>Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, and LinkedIn are some of the popular social networking websites. Pinterest is a social networking website that provides a platform for planning, collecting, discussing, and sharing ideas, common interests and directing traffic to the business portals or blogs. In own words of Pinterest it is <q>the visual bookmarking tool that helps you discover and save creative ideas.</q></p>
<p>Though Pinterest was launched almost 5 years after Facebook and Twitter, it has 100 hundred million active users with 176 million registration. These numbers show that there is a lot of people using Pinterest. Business owners around the world can utilize this website as a traffic generating and audience creating tool for marketing their business.</p>
<p>Let us now discuss the basics of Pinterest and how to employ its features.</p>
<h2>Working Principle of Pinterest</h2>
<p>Imagine a notice board in front of you. You can write or print some valuable piece of information about your products or services on a blank page and just pin it on the board to inform people about they exist. Any person passing by the notice the board can notice the page of your information. Pinterest works exactly the same way.</p>
<img src="/pinterest_marketing/images/pinterest_working_principle.jpg" alt="Pinterest Working Principle" />
<p>You can register your name or business on Pinterest and have a virtual notice board associated to your Pinterest account. After your first pin on the board, you can pen down your similar ideas and relevant images and pin them to the Pinterest board. A board typically represents a category of content. The person viewing the notice board (viewing your profile) can follow all contents on your board or any single board of interest. A board can have multiple contributors. The members of a board are abided by and can pin with the rules of the board.</p>
<p>Pinterest offers a simple yet unique visual interface with high quality pictures.</p>
<h2>What is Pinterest Used For?</h2>
<p>Pinterest is widely used for the following purposes &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>To bookmark an interesting idea, a recipe, a DIY project, an article, or a quote, the way you bookmark a chit on board in real life for later use.</p></li>
<li><p>To direct the traffic to your blog or business portal.</p></li>
<li><p>To advertise your products and services.</p></li>
<li><p>To promote your business.</p></li>
<li><p>To sell your products or service.</p></li>
<li><p>To communicate with other people on the Pinterest.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>What is Pinning?</h3>
<p>It is nothing but adding a bookmark. When user clicks on a pin, it redirects the user to the website where it came from so that you can discover and know further. You can also find pins from other people. Anything on the Internet can be pinned; may it be a delicious-looking recipe, a DIY project, a quote, an article, or your next adventure.</p>
<h3>What are Pinterest Boards?</h3>
<p>Pinterest boards are used to save pins and categorize them thematically. You can add boards while pinning. There are general three types of boards &minus; Regular, Secret, and Group. Boards are covered in chapter “Pinterest Boards”.</p>
<h2>Types of Pinterest Accounts</h2>
<p>Pinterest has two options for accounts that showcase your profile &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Personal account</li>
<li>Business account</li>
</ul>
<p>Both accounts on Pinterest are free for registration.</p>
<img src="/pinterest_marketing/images/pinterest_accounts.jpg" alt="Pinterest Accounts" />
<p>There is not much difference between these two types of profiles except some rules and key features like analytics and widgets.</p>
<p>Here are a few differences in personal and business accounts of Pinterest &minus;</p>

<h1>Pinterest Marketing - Pinning</h1>
<p>Everything is published in the form of pins on Pinterest. The collection of pins is saved on boards. Pinterest enables to change the name or description of a board any time you want to.

<h2>Types of Pinterest Boards</h2>
<p>As said earlier, there are three types of Pinterest boards &minus; Regular, Secret, and Group.</p>
<h3>Regular Boards</h3>
<p>These are the ones where you can publish a ready idea. This board publishes without any pins from any collaborator.</p>
<h3>Secret Boards</h3>
<p>Every idea is not always publish ready. Sometimes it can happen that you are working ahead on your pin but the corresponding post on your website is yet to be complete. At such time you can store your pin to your secret boards. You can also discuss with the other collaborator of the board before your follower knows about the pin. Pinterest secret boards are pretty much same as normal boards only with the option of storing invisible pins.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Secret boards and the pins of the boards are not visible to your followers.</li>
