<h1>Jagannath Temple - History</h1>
<h2>Jagannath Temple under Ganga Dynasty</h2>
<p>Jagannath Temple was constructed by King Chodaganga. The king started the construction and <b>Jaga mohan</b> or the assembly hall and <b>Vimana</b> or chariot of the temple were constructed during his reign. Later <b>Anangabhima Deva</b> completed the construction of the temple in 1174AD.</p>
<h2>Legend Regarding Jagannath Temple</h2>
<p>A legend says that Indradyumna was a king who worshipped <b>Lord Vishnu</b> very much. Once the king was informed that Lord Vishnu has come in the form of <b>Nila Madhava</b> so the king sent a priest named <b>Vidyapati</b> to search for him. While travelling, Vidyapati reached a place where <b>Sabaras </b> were residing. <b>Vishvavasu</b> was the local chief who invited Vidyapati to live with him.</p>
<p>Vishvavasu had a daughter named <b>Lalita</b> and Vidyapati married her after sometime. Vidyapati noticed that when his father-in-law returns, his body had a good smell of sandalwood, camphor, and musk. On asking his wife, she told him about the worship of Nila Madhava by her father. Vidyapati asked his father-in-law to take him to Nila Madhava. Visvavasu blindfolded him and took him to the cave. Vidyapati took with him seeds of mustard which he dropped on the way so as to remember the route to the cave.</p>
<p>Vidyapati informed the king so he came to the place but, to his disappointment, the deity  disappeared. In order to see the deity, he observed fast unto death on <b>Mount Neela</b>. Once he heard a voice saying that he will see the deity so he sacrificed a horse and built a temple and <b>Narada</b> installed the idol of <b>Sri Narsimha</b> in the temple.</p>
<img src="/jagannath_temple/images/ganga_dynasty.jpg" alt="Ganga Dynasty" />
<p>One night he slept and saw <b>Lord Jagannath</b> in his dream. He also heard a voice telling him about a fragrant tree and ordered him to make idols from it. So the king made the idols of Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subhadra. Along with it, he also made the Sudarshan Chakra.</p>
<p>Then the king prayed to <b>Lord Brahma</b> to visit the temple and the deities. Lord Brahma was very pleased when he saw the temple asked about a desire which he (Lord Brahma) can fulfil. The king asked that there shall be no issues in his life and he should be the last one from his family. He also asked that if anybody is left in his family, then he should work for the temple and not the society.</p>
<h2>Invasions on the Temple</h2>
<p>The temple was invaded by many rulers and the count goes to eighteen. The temple was plundered and looted because of enormous wealth present in it. Due to these attacks, the idols of Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subhadra were transferred to various places in order to save them.</p>
