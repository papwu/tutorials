<h1>Triathlon - Overview</h1>
<p>Triathlon is a multi-stage competition similar to Pentathlon where players compete against each other in three set of different sport events which are <b>swimming, cycling</b>, and <b>running</b>. Triathlon demands a lot of physical endurance.</p>
<img src="/triathlon/images/triathlon_competition.jpg" alt="Triathlon Competition" />
<p>In this sport, the players compete with each other in three different sport disciplines. The sport starts with the swimming event that is trailed by a bicycle event and at the end, the players’ race against each other in running event. The first three players to finish the three events are declared winners.</p>
<h2>A Brief History of Triathlon</h2>
<p>Triathlon was invented at the San Diego Track Club mostly as an alternative to rigorous track exercises. Directed by Jack Johnstone and Don Shanahan, a total of 46 participants participated in the first competition. At the beginning, the sport s involved were 10km run, cycling of 8 km and 500 metre swimming.</p>
<p>On September 25, 1974, the first triathlon event was held. Slowly the sport  started gaining popularity and in 1989, the International Triathlon Union (ITU) was founded at France. It was awarded Olympic status in 1989 and in 2000, for the first time, triathlon was included in Olympics Games.</p>
<h2>Participating Countries</h2>
<p>Triathlon is quite popular around the world. People largely follow this sport for better physical endurance and stamina as well as a cardiovascular exercise. Around the world, this sport is played includes thousands of events.  Presently players from around 50 countries all over the world participate in different triathlon events.</p>
<p>Some of the countries where people in large numbers participate in different triathlon events worldwide are Switzerland, Canada, New Zealand, Austria, Germany, Great Britain, Spain, USA, Portugal, and France.</p>
<h1>Triathlon - Equipment</h1>
<p>As triathlon is combination of three sports i.e. swimming, cycling and running, large number of equipment is required for all the individual sports starting from swimming to running. Some of the basic equipment are as follows &minus;</p>
<h2>Swimming Equipment</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Wet suit</b> &minus; The participant must have a set of wet suit required in swimming. It will keep the body of swimmer warm and increases the buoyancy as a result helping him/her in swimming.  The silky surface of the suit helps in reducing the friction with water.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Goggles</b> &minus; The goggles protect the eyes of the swimmer during swimming and improve his/her visibility which in turn helps in improving the execution time. Goggles should fit well such that it will not allow the water in the swimmer’s eyes while he/she is trying to see in the water.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/triathlon/images/swimming_equipment.jpg" alt="Swimming Equipment" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Swim cap</b> &minus; The main purpose of swim cap is to reduce the resistance and drag while swimming which results in increasing the speed. It keeps the hair stay away from face and helps to keep the goggle straps in the correct position.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Tri suits</b> &minus; This suit is convenient for entire race, i.e. it is suitable for all three sports. This will reduce the time and energy in changing from one suit to another. This suit is light-weighted and gets dry fast which will increase the comfort while riding bike and running.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Cycling Equipment</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Bicycle</b> &minus;  It is one of the important equipment for cycling event. For this sport, a normal bicycle can be used but there also some specially designed bicycle for this sport. Bicycle should be well serviced, properly oiled, and chain, brakes and gears should be in proper working condition.</p>
<p>These bicycles have special aerodynamic wheels, aero- handle bars and other components. It has a steep seat tube, which helps the players spare their muscles that are used for running.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Bicycle Repair Kit</b> &minus; This kit will be very helpful when there any sudden repairs are needed. This may reduce the time spent for any repairs made in the bike.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/triathlon/images/bicycle_repair_kit.jpg" alt="Bicycle Repair Kit" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Helmet</b> &minus; This equipment is mandatory for cycling. This will protect the riders from any head injury due to some unfortunate accidents or collision. Helmet should fit comfortably on the player’s head for proper balance during the sport.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Cycling Shoes</b> &minus; Some players attach shoes to the paddle which will help in maintaining stability and easy to ride.  They will also protect the leg from injury. These are specially made shoes for triathlon which are easier to wear to reduce the transition time.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Running Equipment</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Running Shoes</b> &minus; Shoes should be comfortable and light-weighted. Generally these shoes are used with elastic shoelaces which will make the shoe to pull easy without wasting time to remove the shoelaces.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Socks</b> &minus; As the socks are not used in swimming section of the sports, but it is mandatory for other two sports. Wearing socks is time consuming shoes without socks may lead to painful scratches on the foot.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Triathlon - Playing Environment</h1>
<p>As this sport involves three sports, the race starts with swimming pool, gets continued in cycling track and ends up on running track. The length of the pool and track depends upon the age group participating the race and the competitiveness.</p>
<h2>Swimming Pool</h2>
<p>The pool may contain hot or cold water. It is divided into lanes and starts with <b>Zero</b>. The competitor must swim in his/her lane to reach the end of the pool. The length and depth of the pool vary from sport to sport  and on the age group.</p>
<h2>Cycling Track</h2>
<p>In some competition, the cycle tracks are also divided into lanes and the individual must ride his/her bike in the lane. The track may or may not have slope. It may be situated at sidewalk level or road level.</p>
<h2>Running Track</h2>
<p>This is the last phase of the race. On successfully completing the running on the track, the competitor finishes the race. This track may or may not be divided into lanes. Running track can be one sided or two sided and may be on roadside or sidewalk level.</p>
<img src="/triathlon/images/running_track.jpg" alt="Running Track" />
<h1>Triathlon - How to Play?</h1>
<p>The rules of this sport are pretty simple and they change from competition to competition. There is no restriction in how to swim, cycle and run. There are two transitions in between the two sports i.e. one between swimming and cycling and second transition between cycling and running.</p>
<p>Race time is calculated in five sections &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Swim Time</b> &minus; It is calculated from the start of swimming to beginning of transition.</p></li>
<li><p><b>T1 Time</b> &minus; It is calculated from start of transition to end of transition.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Cycling Time</b> &minus; It is calculated from the start of cycling to the beginning of second transition.</p></li>
<li><p><b>T2 time</b> &minus; It is calculated from start of transition to end of transition.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Running Time</b> &minus; It is calculated from start of run to the finish line.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/triathlon/images/cycling_time.jpg" alt="Cycling Time" />
<h3>Transition Change</h3>
<p>Players change from one sport to another in a designated place which is called the <b>transition place</b>. The first transition place is between the swimming and cycling competition and the second transition place is between cycling and running. Players change their equipment for the next event in these transition places.</p>
<h2>Starting the Competition</h2>
<p>Usually the competition starts with swimming.  Different methods are followed in order to organize the swimming competition. In case of small number of participants, all athletes enter into the pool simultaneously and competition starts whereas in case of large number of participants, the whole group is divided into smaller groups based on their age or predicted swimming time.</p>
<img src="/triathlon/images/swimming.jpg" alt="Swimming" />
<p>Usually in case of triathlon, there are no pools or markers during the swimming. Instead the players swim in open water stage which makes it really hard for the players to get a proper position during the competition. Players usually try to get advantage by drafting any other competitors.</p>
<h2>Start with Swimming</h2>
<p>In swimming, competitors use the swimming strokes in a less vigorous way as compared to normal swimming competitions, which enables less pressure on legs as they need more strength in legs for continuing in the race during cycling and running. So they mostly use <b>Dolphin kicking</b> techniques while swimming.</p>
<p>Players follow many altered and modified strokes in order to swim against the turbulent water which helps them in conserving energy for the rest events. During the end part of the swimming, the players go for body surfing, which enables them to use the speed of the wave for their own swimming speed.</p>
<h3>Open Water Swimming</h3>
<p>In case of open water stage, the players occasionally have to go for sighting, which includes lifting their heads during the swimming to see the landmark of the course. Players often make modified strokes during the swim, which helps them to lift their head above the water for a sight without even interrupting the swimming process.</p>
<h2>Transition from Swimming to Cycling</h2>
<p>Each group enters into water after every few seconds. Once the participant is out of water, he/she moves to the transition area and changes his/her wet suit to pull on a cycling suit. Here also players apply different tricks to change the suits in order to reduce the transition time. Then the players start racing against each other using their bicycle on a marked course.</p>
<img src="/triathlon/images/cycling.jpg" alt="Cycling" />
<h3>Cycling</h3>
<p>The cycling in triathlon differs largely from normal cycling competitions mostly because of <b>drafting</b>. Drafting is a technique, where the players follow the slipstream of the forward player, which helps in reducing 50% of the pedal effort needed and is very much helpful in conserving energy. Drafting is allowed in triathlon whereas it is not allowed in individual competitions.</p>
<p>Usually a group of players choose a leader for drafting who works as the forward player while other players work towards helping him/her stay off the wind. With time, one by one, all the players take the place of the leader while others stay in his/her slipstream.</p>
<p>The whole process of changing the leader with time and drafting together while riding is known as <b>paceline</b>.</p>
<p>In order to reduce their transition time between swimming and cycling, players also bind their shoes on the cycle pedal and instead of wearing it in the transition place, they start riding their bicycle as soon as the marking line for swimming is finished and then wear their shoes in the middle way. They also avoid using socks in order to save more time.</p>
<h2>Transition from Cycling to Running</h2>
<p>Once the players have finished the cycling, they move on to the racing track by racking their cycle and quickly wear the racing suit and start racing against each other on the racing track. Racing is the final event of triathlon and the players have to pass a finishing line in order to complete the race.</p>
<img src="/triathlon/images/running.jpg" alt="Running" />
<h3>Running</h3>
<p>After swimming and cycling, the players while facing running events are literally tired of muscle weakness. The transition between cycling and running has a profound effect on the players which leads to running at slower rate than they are capable of. To avoid that, players go for a special workout during their training phase, which is known as <b>bricks</b></p>
<p>Competitor must cross the transition line to start their respective races i.e. after swimming and crossing the transition point, he/she can start riding the bicycle only after crossing the transition line and same goes for running. He/she can start running only after crossing the second transition finish line or else this may lead to disqualification.</p>
<h1>Triathlon - Rules</h1>
<p>Triathlon consists of three sports and each sport has different rules which the players have to follow.</p>
<h2>Rules on Swimming</h2>
<p>The competitors can swim in any position as they wish and comfortable with. There is no restriction if they want to stand in between the race and relax. The important rule is that a competitor may wear a wet suit for swimming when the temperature is 78- 84 degree Fahrenheit.</p>
<img src="/triathlon/images/rules_of_swimming.jpg" alt="Rules of Swimming" />
<p>Wetsuits are prohibited when the temperature is above 84 degree Fahrenheit. Players are strictly prohibited from using any kind of floating materials during the competition which might result in disqualification of the player. Players can’t throw any garbage or equipment on the course during and after the event.</p>
<h2>Rules on Cycling</h2>
<p>For cycling the competitor must wear helmet during the cycling event or he/she may be disqualified. The player has to complete buckling up the chin strap of his/her helmet even before boarding on the bike. In this part of the sport, competitor must not draft or block others way while cycling and should allow them to pass them or else this may lead to disqualification.</p>
<p>Even during drafting, the player must maintain a minimum three bike lengths distance between the forward players. Players are not allowed to propel the bicycle other than pushing including use of hands to push the cycle. During the race, players are not allowed to race off the course and have to follow the traffic rules.</p>
<img src="/triathlon/images/rules_of_cycling.jpg" alt="Rules of Cycling" />
<p>Players are not allowed to either carry or wear headphones, headsets or any kind of mp3 player during the race. Players are strictly prohibited from using foul, harsh or any kind of abusive language during the race either toward each other or towards any event officials.</p>
