<h1>SAP EWM - Overview</h1>
<p>SAP Extended Warehouse Management (EWM) is used to efficiently manage inventory in the Warehouse and for supporting processing of goods movement. It allows the company to control their Warehouse inbound and outbound processes and movement of goods in the Warehouse.</p>
<p>The main process in a Warehouse is incoming and outgoing materials, goods receipt and goods issue, fulfil customer orders, and distribution of goods. When a company doesn’t store any goods, then there is no need of Warehouse management to manage goods.</p>
<p>Inbound process involves storage of goods in warehouse and their location and Outbound process involves picking up the goods. Whenever a material is stored in a warehouse, it is stored in the storage bin and you can find its current location.</p>
<p>With the help of SAP EWM all the goods movement are controlled by a warehouse management system and provides you the tools to monitor warehouse activities. You can also manage additional functions in the Warehouse like creating a serial number, batch number, vendor management inventory, resource optimization and value added services. SAP Extended Warehouse Management allows you to not only monitor the quantity of goods in Warehouse but to manage other critical functions and delivery of goods efficiently.</p>
<p>SAP Warehouse Management is opposite to Inventory management. Inventory management tells the count of goods in the storage location and its physical location is unknown. Warehouse management deals with goods movement and monitoring the physical location of the goods recorded with specific documents.</p>
<h3>SAP EWM is different from SAP Warehouse Management</h3>
<p>SAP EWM is a part of SAP Supply Chain Management like Warehouse management system but provides more robust and advanced features to manage key activities in the Warehouse.</p>
<p>SAP Extended Warehouse Management is similar to Warehouse management but it provides more features like picking, put away, RF framework, Warehouse structure and more flexible options to manage the warehouse functions.</p>
<p>You can create new elements like an activity area, resources, labor management and work centers in SAP EWM which were not available in WM.</p>
<p>SAP EWM provides more a robust solution to manage warehouse functions in an organization. It is also a part of SAP Supply Chain Management and also supports all the processes within logistics and supply chain.</p>
<h2>SAP EWM ─ Key Features</h2>
<p>The following are the key features in SAP EWM &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Using SAP EWM, you can control the warehouse activities like picking, posting and managing storage bin and good receipts.</p></li>
<li><p>You can set alert for changed data before goods receipt from EWM to the ERP system, reversal or correction of the goods receipt from EWM to the ERP system and an inbound delivery split from EWM to the ERP system.</p></li>
<li><p>You can perform deconsolidation of handling units which contain different products before putting them away in different storage sections.</p></li>
<li><p>You can determine storage concepts using slotting for products and optimize arrangement of goods warehouse automatically.</p></li>
<li><p>It allows you to perform executable tasks like work packages, consisting of warehouse tasks warehouse employees should perform as part of warehouse management activities.</p></li>
<li><p>It allows you to manage and track vehicles as well as other transportation units from the yard check-in to yard check-out, including movements and other tasks within the yard.</p></li>
<li><p>SAP EWM also includes storage and handling of hazardous substances and their transportation in accordance with the regulations from SAP Environmental Health &amp; Safety EHS.</p></li>
<li><p>In SAP EWM, you can also plan labor times and resources more effectively and hence you can make your Warehouse efficient by managing key resource management tasks effectively.</p></li>
<li><p>In SAP EWM, you can use Warehouse cockpit that allows you to display warehouse key figures graphically and to evaluate or monitor activities using defined chart types.</p></li>
<li><p>You can use cross-docking that allows you to perform transportation of handling units across different distribution centers or warehouses till they reach final location in the Warehouse.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Deployed Options in SAP EWM</h2>
<p>SAP EWM can be considered as deployed in an ERP server or you can also consider it as an application in the Supply Chain Management landscape.</p>
<p>SAP Extended Warehouse Management is integrated with ERP to access transaction and master data and use of features like slotting, availability check also requires its integration with CRM.</p>
<p>It is considered as a separate application and shares the same server with the SCM applications. You can also run SAP EWM in its own SCM environment which is suitable to get improved performance.</p>
<h3>EWM Deployment Options</h3>
<p>The following image shows the deployment options for SAP EWM &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Figure 1 shows SAP EWM on SCM Server.</li>
<li>Figure 2 shows SAP EWM as Standalone.</li>
</ul>
<img src="/sap_ewm/images/ewm_deployment_options.jpg" alt="EWM Deployment Options" />
<h2>Communication Method</h2>
<p>SAP ERP and EWM are closely integrated with each other for transfer of transaction and master data. There are two different ways of communication.</p>
<p><b>Core Interface (CIF)</b> &minus; Core interface is one of the common method for communication between SAP SCM system and SAP Advanced Planning and Optimization APO. Master data maintained in ERP system like customer, material and vendor which are available in ERP system are transferred to EWM system use Core Interface CIF communication.</p>
<img src="/sap_ewm/images/communication_method.jpg" alt="Communication Method" />
<p>For transaction data (inbound/outbound delivery docs), a separate integration model is used for communication. This model uses iDocs or queued remote function call RFC.</p>
<h3>How to check various menu structure of EWM system?</h3>
<p>Login to the SCM system and navigate to the Extended Warehouse management node in the SAP menu. You can use various transactions to manage basic functions in Warehouse management &minus;</p>

<h1>SAP EWM - Organization Units</h1>
<p>In SAP ERP, a warehouse number is used to represent the physical warehouse where all the material is stored. A Warehouse number is a 3 or 4 character field in Warehouse management or EWM respectively. Warehouse numbers are created in the ERP system and to activate it, you use a combination of plant and storage location assigned to this plant with the respective warehouse number.</p>
<h2>Types of Organization Units</h2>
<p>There are different organization units in a Warehouse system at different levels &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Warehouse Number</b> &minus; Each warehouse consists of a warehouse number which is at the highest level in a warehouse management system. Each warehouse number consists of a sub structure that maps the warehouse relationship.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Storage Type</b> &minus; There are different types of storage where products are physically stored in a warehouse such as open storage, goods issue and goods receipt, racks.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Storage Section</b> &minus; This is a part of storage type and represents a group of bins with same characteristics. Commonly used storage sections are fast moving or slow moving items, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/sap_ewm/images/organization_units_types.jpg" alt="Organization Units Types" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Storage Bin</b> &minus; The Storage bins represent the physical location of storage space where the products are stored in Warehouse. They are at the lowest level of the organization structure and when you store an item in a Warehouse you need to mention its exact location.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Activity Areas</b> &minus; Storage bins are further categorized in this activity area. It includes activities like picking, put away or a physical inventory. As per the activity, you can assign the same storage bin to multiple activity areas.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Quant</b> &minus; The quantity of goods in the storage bin is represented by Quant. The quant is used for managing inventory in storage bin.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/sap_ewm/images/storage_units.jpg" alt="Storage Units" />
<h3>How to Create Storage Bins and Block them for Put Away?</h3>
<p>To create a Storage bin, you can use <b>T-Code: /SCWM/LS01</b> or</p>
<p>Navigate to the <b>Extended Warehouse Management &rarr; Master data &rarr; Storage Bin &rarr; Create Storage Bin</b>.</p>

<img src="/sap_ewm/images/save_entry.jpg" alt="Save Entry" />
<p></p>
<img src="/sap_ewm/images/change_storage.jpg" alt="Change Storage" />
<p>You can also remove the put-away block by going to Warehouse monitor again.</p>
<h1>SAP EWM - Master Data</h1>
<p>In the ERP system, you have master data which includes the details of the customer, vendor, plant and shipping point which are also used by the SCM. At the time of data transfer using CIM, this data is copied to the corresponding to SCM master data. For example, the location.</p>

<h1>SAP EWM - Structure Elements</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss regarding the different structure elements that are available in SAP Extended Warehouse Management.</p>
<h2>Types of Structure Elements</h2>
<p>As discussed in the previous chapter, there are various organization elements in SAP Extended Warehouse Management. These elements are also known as structure elements of a warehouse system.</p>
<p>The Warehouse consists of the following elements in the hierarchical structure &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Warehouse Number</li>
<li>Storage Type</li>
<li>Storage Section</li>
<li>Storage bin</li>
<li>Activity Area</li>
</ul>
<p>The highest unit in a Warehouse is the Warehouse number and the smallest unit is a storage bin. A Storage Bin tells the exact location of a product in a warehouse.</p>
<p><b>Warehouse Number</b> &minus; Each warehouse consists of a warehouse number which is at the highest level in a warehouse management system. Each warehouse number consists of a sub structure that maps the warehouse relationship.</p>
<p><b>Storage Section</b> &minus; This is a part of storage type and represents a group of bins with the same characteristics. The commonly used storage sections are fast moving or slow moving items, etc.</p>
<img src="/sap_ewm/images/storage_section.jpg" alt="Storage Section" />
<p><b>Storage Bin</b> &minus; The storage bins represent the physical location of a storage space where the products are stored in a Warehouse. They are at the lowest level of organization structure and when you store an item in a Warehouse you need to mention its exact location.</p>
<p><b>Activity Areas</b> &minus; Storage bins are further categorized in activity areas. It includes activities like picking, put away or a physical inventory. As per the activity, you can assign the same storage bin to multiple activity areas.</p>
<p><b>Quant</b> &minus; The quantity of goods in a storage bin is represented by Quant. The quant is used for managing inventory in a storage bin.</p>
<h2>Storage Types</h2>
<p>There are different types of storage where products are physically stored in a warehouse such as &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Open storage</li>
<li>Goods Issue</li>
<li>Goods Receipt</li>
<li>Racks</li>
</ul>
<p>A Storage type is a four-character name and shows a physical or a logical subdivision of a warehouse. A Storage type can consist of one or more storage sections and bins. A storage type is defined by the role it is used for in a warehouse.</p>
<p>A storage type can be used for the following roles &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Standard Storage Type</b> &minus; Physical area where products are stored in a warehouse.</p></li>

<h1>SAP EWM - Warehouse Process Types</h1>
<p>A Warehouse process type is used to define the activity or movement of each process in a warehouse. It deals with each warehouse process like packing, good receipt, good issue and is assigned to each warehouse task document.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>For simple movements, warehouse process type defines the storage type and bin for the movement of goods. Warehouse process type is defined at the point of creation of the warehouse document or in separate step.</p>
<p>All warehouse process types are further grouped into warehouse process categories. Warehouse process categories are used to define the goods movement in a warehouse.</p>
<img src="/sap_ewm/images/warehouse_process_types.jpg" alt="Warehouse Process Types" />
<p>There are different warehouse process categories that are predefined in the EWM system &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">

<h1>SAP EWM - Selling and Receiving Goods</h1>
<p>This involves goods shipping and receiving and they are stored in a warehouse. Receiving goods process starts in the ERP system when a purchase requisition is detected and purchase order is created. A purchase order consists of the quantity of material and store and plant location. There are two ways to handle a purchase order request, which are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>First is to send the purchase order to supplier for goods delivery and once goods are received, goods receipt is posted.</p></li>
<li><p>Other way is to receive an announcement from supplier about the goods arrival as per purchase order request.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/sap_ewm/images/purchase_order_request.jpg" alt="Purchase Order Request" />
<p>When a purchase order is created, you can set a CTRL key to enable notification from supplier. When you set the control key, an inbound delivery must be created on the basis of the purchase order. When a control key is set and an inbound delivery is not created, you can put the goods receipt.</p>
<p>An inbound delivery contains the information about the goods arrival, quantity of goods, store and plant location. The system checks the combination of the plant and storage location to check if the warehouse is in the EWM and then the system replicates an inbound delivery notification in the EWM system.</p>
<p><b>An Inbound Processing includes</b> &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Good receipt and optimization</li>
<li>Transportation unit inspection</li>
<li>Quality Inspection</li>

</ul>
<h2>Process Flow</h2>
<img src="/sap_ewm/images/process_flow.jpg" alt="Process Flow" />
<p>Whenever you make any changes in the inbound delivery document, these changes are reverted in the ERP system. The status of the inbound delivery is updated as per goods delivery. If the status of an inbound delivery document is execution completed, it shows proof of delivery in the ERP.</p>
<h1>SAP EWM - Maintaining Serial Numbers</h1>
<p>Using serial numbers, you can easily track the location of goods in the warehouse. A serial number can be used to identify the vendor and receiver details who has sent and received goods in a warehouse.</p>
<p>A serial number is a series of characters that have been assigned to each product in the warehouse so that it remains separate and are identified in the warehouse system. You can use serial numbers up to a length of 30 characters in an EWM system. However, SAP recommends to use a maximum of 18 characters to make it compatible with the ERP system.</p>
<h2>Types of Serial Number Profiles</h2>
<p>To assign serial numbers to a product, you use a serial number profile that determines transactions for issuing a serial number to the products.</p>
<p>There are two different types of serial number profiles that can be used &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Sales General Plant</b> &minus; This serial number profiles are used in the ERP system and must be defined to use serial numbers in the delivery documents for goods issue or receipts.</p></li>
<li><p><b>LES Serial Number</b> &minus; This is maintained in the product master data view.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When you click on the WM execution, you need to select serial number profile which is sent to SCM system and is used in EWM.</p>
<p>A serial number profile is maintained in the ERP or in the EWM system. There are four types of serial number requirement available in the system &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Serial Number for Document items</b> &minus; This serial number is used for returns. When a customer complains about a product and return is raised, you can perform a check if this is the same product that is supplied to him. This serial number is not used for other warehouse tasks.</p></p></li>
<li><p><b>Serial Numbers on warehouse number level</b> &minus; This serial number requirement type is used to check which serial number is available in your warehouse.</p></p></li>
<li><p><b>Serial number of warehouse movement</b> &minus; This serial number requirement type is used to know the exact storage bin information for products. Serial numbers are used in each warehouse task and must be entered before posting goods receipt or goods issue.</p></p></li>
<li><p><b>No Serial number requirement</b> &minus; This requirement type is used when some products are serialized in few of the warehouses.</p></p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Issuing a Provisional Serial Number</h3>
<p>It is required to enter serial numbers before posting a goods issue or a goods receipt. In this scenario, you can configure the system to use provisional serial numbers.</p>
<p>The provisional serial numbers are 30 characters and always start with a <b>&dollar; sign</b>. When you post goods receipt, provisional serial number is assigned and when you confirm putaway warehouse tasks, you must replace the provisional serial number with the real ones.</p>
<h1>SAP EWM - Value Added Services</h1>
<p>The Value Added Services define the product processing to be performed in a warehouse and includes activities like packing, labeling, assembling, etc.</p>
<p>To perform interim steps in the goods issue or goods receipt, you can use storage control to perform interim steps.</p>
<p>In the following illustration, you can see the process flow of the Value Added Services in a warehouse function &minus;</p>
<img src="/sap_ewm/images/value_added_services.jpg" alt="Value Added Services" />
<h2>Value Added Services Order</h2>
