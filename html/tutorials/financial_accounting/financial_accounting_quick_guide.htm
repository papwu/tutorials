<h1>Financial Accounting - Rectification of Errors</h1>
<p>Financial accounting deals with recording and maintaining every monetary transaction of an organization. However, sometimes, a few entries might be either incorrect or used at the wrong place. In financial accounting, the process of correcting such mistakes is known as <b>Rectification of Errors</b>.</p>
<h2>Types of Errors</h2>
<p>Two most common types of errors, which are usually occurred at the time of preparation of Financial Statements are discussed below.</p>
<h3>Error which Effect only One Account</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>Omission of posting of balance in a Trial Balance.</li>
<li>Error of carried forward of balance.</li>
<li>Error of casting and posting.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Error which Effect Two or more Accounts</h3>
<p>The nature of errors, which occur during the preparation of Financial Statements are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Error of posting in wrong account.</li>
<li>Error of principle.</li>
<li>Error of omission.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Methods of Rectification of Errors</h2>
<p>There are three types of methods used in rectification of Errors &minus;</p>
<h3>Replacing Correct Figure by Striking Off the Wrong Figure</h3>
<p>For example, cash payment of Rs. 989 on the account of stationery purchased written as Rs. 998, will be corrected as &minus;</p>
<h3>Cash Book</h3>
<table style="text-align:center;" class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<td style="width:25%;"></td>
<td style="width:25%;"></td>
<td style="width:27%;"><p>By Stationery A/c</p></td>
<td style="width:25%;"><p style="text-align:right;"><strike>998</strike></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">989</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Through Journal Entry</h3>
<p>Normally, there are three types of errors, which can be rectified by passing Journal Entries &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Short credited or debit in one account and excess debit or credit in another account. For example, purchase of stationery for Rs. 989 wrongly debited to purchase of raw material account will be corrected as follows &minus;</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Journal Entry</b></p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<td style="width:70%;"><p>Stationery Account<span style="padding-left:30%;">Dr.</span></p>
<p>To Purchase Account</p>
<p>(Being Cash purchase of stationery wrongly debited to Purchase account, now rectified)</p>
</td>
<td width="15%;"><p style="text-align:center;">989</p></td>
<td><p style="text-align:center;margin-top:45%;">989</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>If, <b><i>by mistake one account is debited as well as credited with wrong amount simultaneously</i></b>. For example, Cash purchase of stationery of Rs. 989 booked with an amount of Rs. 489 will be corrected as follows &minus;</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Journal Entry</b></p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<td style="width:70%;"><p>Stationery Account<span style="padding-left:30%;">Dr.</span></p>
<p>To Purchase Account</p>
<p>(Being purchase of stationery for Rs. 989 wrongly written as Rs. 489 now rectified)</p>
</td>
<td width="15%;"><p style="text-align:center;">500</p></td>
<td><p style="text-align:center;margin-top:45%;">500</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>If there is an omission of recording a transaction, it can be rectified by passing journal entry to book that omitted transaction. For example, omission of recording transaction of purchase of raw material for Rs. 5000 from Mr. X will be recorded and corrected by passing the following journal Entry &minus;</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Journal Entry</b></p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<td style="width:70%;"><p>Stationery Account<span style="padding-left:30%;">Dr.</span></p>
<p>To X Account</p>
<p>(Being omitted entry of purchase of Rs. 5000 from Mr. X now recorded and rectified)</p>
</td>
<td width="15%;"><p style="text-align:center;">5000</p></td>
<td><p style="text-align:center;margin-top:45%;">5000</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>If there is a Mistake that Effects Trial Balance</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Before closing the books and transferring the difference in suspense account and</p></li>
<li><p>After the agreed difference is transferred into the suspense account, following accounting treatment will be done &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Earlier entry debited or credited with fewer amount will be rectified by repeating that entry with difference amount to complete that amount. For example, entry done with Rs. 500 instead of Rs. 5000 will be rectified by doing same entry with an amount of Rs. 4500. In case, where entry wrongly debited or credited to other account may be rectified by doing reversal of old entry to nullify earlier effect.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If expense booked with less amount entry then &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<td style="width:70%;"><p>Particular Expense Account</p>
<p>To Cash/Personal Account</p>
<p>(Being wrong amount of posting, rectified with Difference amount Rs. 4,500 (5000-500)</p></td>
<td width="15%;"><p style="text-align:center;">Dr</p></td>
<td><p style="text-align:center;">4,500</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">4,500</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>If income is booked with less amount, it will be rectified as &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<td style="width:70%;"><p>Cash/Personal account</p>
<p>To Income Account</p>
<p>(Being wrong amount of posting now Rectified. 4500 (5000-500)</p></td>
<td width="15%;"><p style="text-align:center;">Dr</p></td>
<td><p style="text-align:center;">4,500</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">4,500</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>If posting done in wrong account that will be rectified as follows &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<td><p>Stationery Account<span style="padding-left:20%;">Dr.</span><span style="padding-left:10%;">**</span></p>
<p>To Office Expenses  Account<span style="padding-left:25%;">**</span></p>
<p>(Being wrongly debited earlier in office account, now Rectified and posted in stationery account)</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>In case (ii) where difference has already been transferred to suspense account, further amount will be debited or credited to respective account and correspondingly suspense account will be debited or credited. Thus, these entries would reduce/nil the balance of suspense account.</p>
<h3>Effect of Errors on Agreement of Trial Balance</h3>
<p>The errors by which there is no change on both side of trial balance or wrong effect on trial balance with same amount will not lead to effect on agreement of Trial Balance. Errors of omission, error of posting with wrong amount on both side, or Error of principles are the example of such errors. To find out such errors is a challenging job for any book keeper or an accountant.</p>
<h3>Effects of Errors on Financial Statements</h3>
<p>Effect of error depends on the nature of effected accounts. If errors relate to nominal account, it will either increase or reduce the profit and rectification will reduce excess profit or Loss. Effect of error on Trading and Profit account ultimately effect the Balance-Sheet of a company too, because reduced profit or excess profit ultimately transferred to capital account, which is a part of the Balance Sheet.</p>
<p>There are some errors, which effect Trading or Profit and Loss account and Balance sheet simultaneously, like entry of depreciation will affect profit as well as value of the Fixed Assets.</p>
<p>Some entry may effect on Balance sheet only like, for instance omission of entry of cash paid to purchase fixed assets will affect Balance Sheet of a firm only.</p>
<h3>Rectification of Errors after Preparation of Final Accounts</h3>
<p>To remain unaffected Profit or Loss of the current financial year, the errors, which took place in last financial years are adjusted and rotated through a Profit &amp; Loss adjustment account. Balance of this account directly transferred to capital account of firm without affecting the current year profit or loss.</p>
<h1>Financial Accounting - Capital and Revenue</h1>
<p>One of the major aspects of preparing a correct financial statement is to distinguish revenue and capital in regard to revenue income, revenue expenditure, revenue payments, revenue profits, and revenue losses of the company with capital income, capital receipts, capital profit, or capital losses.</p>
<p>In fact, without differentiating, we cannot think of correctness of a financial statement. Ultimately, it will mislead the end results where no one can conclude anything. As per this principle, a revenue item should be recorded in the Trading and Profit &amp; Loss account and a capital item should be recorded in the Balance-Sheet of respective firm.</p>
<h2>Capital Expenditure</h2>
<p>Capital expenditure is the expenditure incurred to acquire fixed assets, capital leases, office equipment, computer equipment, software development, purchase of tangible and intangible assets, and such kind of any value addition in business with the purpose to enhance the income. However, to decide nature of the capital expenditure, we need to pay attention on &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The expenditure, which benefit cannot be consumed or utilized in the same accounting period, should be treated as <b>capital expenditure</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Expenditure incurred to acquire Fixed Assets for the company.</p></li>
<li><p>Expenditure incurred to acquire fixed assets, erection and installation charges, transportation of assets charges, and travelling expenses directly relates to the purchase fixed assets, are covered under capital expenditure.</p></li>
<li><p>Capital addition to any fixed assets, which increases the life or efficiency of those assets for example, an addition to building.</p></li>

<h2>Deferred Revenue Expenditure</h2>
<p>Some non-recurring and special nature of expenditure for which heavy amount incurred and benefit for the same will spread in up-coming years, to be treated as capital expenditure and will be shown as the assets of the firm. Part of the expenditure should be debited to Profit &amp; Loss account every year.

<h2>Capital and Revenue Profit</h2>

<li><p>Reserve can be made only out of profit and provisions are the charge to profit.</p></li>
<li><p>Reserves reduce divisible profits and provisions reduce the profit.</p></li>
<li><p>Reserves, if remain un-utilized for some period can be distributed as dividends, but provisions cannot be transferred to General Reserve for the distribution.</p></li>
<li><p>Purpose of provision is very specific, but reserve is created to meet out any probable future liabilities or losses.</p></li>
<li><p>Creation of provisions is legally necessary, but reserves are created to save a concern from the future losses and liabilities.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Secret Reserves</h2>
<p>Banking Company, Insurance Company, and Electricity Companies create secret reserves, where the public confidence is required. In this case, to create secret reserve, assets showed at lower cost or liabilities at higher value. Some of the examples of it are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>By undervaluing goodwill or stock</li>
<li>By excessive depreciation</li>
<li>By creating excessive provisions</li>
<li>Showing free reserves as creditors</li>
<li>By charging capital expenditure to profit and loss account</li>
</ul>
<h2>Advantages of Secret Reserves</h2>
<p>Some of the important advantages are given below &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Without disclosing to its shareholders, it increases working capital of a concern, which is a clear indication of the sound financial position.</p></li>
<li><p>With the help of secret reserves, directors can maintain the rate of dividends during the unfavorable time.</p></li>
<li><p>Non-disclosure of a big profit is useful to avoid an un-due competition.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Limitations of Secret Reserves</h2>
<p>Major limitations or objections of secret reserves are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Due to non-disclosure of actual profit, financial statements do not presents true and fair view of the state of affairs.</p></li>
<li><p>There are lots of chances of misuse of reserves by the directors for their personal benefits.</p></li>
<li><p>Due to secret reserves, chances for the concealment of worst position of a company are very high.</p></li>
<li><p>Company will get very lower amount of claim of insurance at the time of loss of stock or other assets, as valuation of the assets are done at very low value to create secret reserve.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>General and Specific Reserves</h2>
<p>Specific reserves are created and utilized for the purpose only for which they are created, like dividend equalization reserve and debenture redemption reserve.</p>
<p>General reserves are created for any future contingency or to utilize at the time of expansion of a business. Purpose of creation of General reserve is to strengthen the financial position of the company and to increase the working capital.</p>
<h2>Sinking Fund</h2>
<p>For the purpose to repay of any liabilities or to replace any fixed assets after particular period, sinking funds are created. For this, some amount are charged or appropriated from the profit and loss account every year and invested in any outside securities. Without any extra ordinary burden, replacement of an asset may be done in a systematic manner or pay any known liability on maturity of the sinking fund.</p>
<h2>Investment of Reserves</h2>
<p>It is a controversial issue, whether a reserve should be invested in outside securities or not. Thus, to decide anything, it is important to study the need and requirement of a firm according to the financial position of a firm. Therefore, investment in outside securities is justified only in a case where company has the extra fund to invest.</p>
<h2>Nature of Reserve</h2>
<p>In-spite of showing reserves on the liabilities side of a Balance Sheet, reserves are actually not at all any liabilities of a firm. Reserve represents as accumulated profits, which are available to disburse among the shareholders.</p>
<h1>Measurement of Business Income</h1>
<p>One of the most significant accounting concepts is “<b>Concept of Income</b>”. Similarly, measurement of a business income is also an important function of an accountant.</p>
<p>In General term, payment received in lieu of services or goods are called income, for example, salary received by any employee is his income. There may be different type of incomes like Gross income, Net income, National Income, and Personal income, but we are here more concerned for a business income. Surplus revenue over expenses incurred is called as “Business Income.”</p>
<h2>Objectives of Net Income</h2>
<p>Following are the important objectives of a net income &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Historical income figure is the base for future projections.</p></li>
<li><p>Ascertainment of a net income is necessary to give portion of profit to employees.</p></li>
<li><p>To evaluate the activities, which give higher return on scarce resources are preferred. It helps to increase the wealth of a firm.</p></li>
<li><p>Ascertainment of a net income is helpful for paying dividends to the shareholders of any company.</p></li>
<li><p>Return of income on capital employed, gives an idea of overall efficiency of a business.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Definition of Income</h2>
<p>The most authentic definition is given by the American Accounting Association as &minus;</p>
<p><i>“The realized net income of an enterprise measures its effectiveness as an operative unit and is the change in its net assets arising out of a (a) the excess or deficiency of revenue compared with related expired cost, and (b) other gains or losses to the enterprise from sales, exchange or other conversion of assets:”.</i></p>
<p>According to the American Accounting Association, to be as business income, income should be realized. For example, to be a business income, only appreciation in value of assets of a company is not enough, for this, asset has really been disposed of.</p>
<h3>Accounting Period</h3>
<p>For the measurement  of any income concerns, instead of a point of time, a span of time is required. Creditors, investors, owners, and government, all of them require systematic accounting reports at regular and proper intervals. The maximum interval between reports is one year, as it helps a businessman to take any corrective action.</p>
<p>An accounting period concept is directly related to matching concept and realization concept; in the absence of any of them, we could not measure income of the concerns. On the basis of matching concept, expenses should be determined in a particular accounting period (usually a year) and matched with the revenue (based on realization concept) and the result will be income or loss of the accounting period.</p>
<h2>Accounting Concept and Income Measurement</h2>
<p>The measurement of accounting income is the subject to several accounting concepts and conventions. Impact of accounting concepts and convention on measurement of the accounting income is given below &minus;</p>
<h3>Conservatism</h3>
<p>Where an income of one period may be shifted to another period for the measurement of income is called as ‘conservatism approach.’</p>
<p>According to the convention of conservatism, the policy of playing safe is followed while determining a business income and an accountant seeks to ensure that the reported profit is not over stated. Measurement of a stock at cost or market price, whichever is less is one of the important examples as applied to measurement of income. But it must be insured that providing excessive depreciation or excessive provisions for a doubt full debt or excessive reserve should not be there.</p>
<h3>Consistency</h3>
<p>According to this concept, the principle of consistency should be followed in accounting practice. For example, in the treatment of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses to insure the comparison of accounting results of one period with another period.</p>
<p>Therefore, the accounting profession and the corporate laws of most of the counties require that financial statement must be made out on the basis that the figures stated are consistent with those of the preceding year.</p>
<h3>Entity Concept</h3>
<p>Proprietor and business are the two separate and different entities according to the entity concept. For example, an interest on capital is business expenditure, but for a proprietor, it is an income. Thus, we cannot treat a business income as personal income or vice-versa.</p>
<h3>Going Concern Concept</h3>
<p>According to this concept, it is assumed that business will continue for a long time. Thus, charging depreciation on a Fixed Asset is based on this concept.</p>
<h3>Accrual Concept</h3>
<p>According to this concept, an income must be recognized in the period in which it was realized and costs must be matched with the revenue of that period.</p>
<h3>Accounting Period</h3>
<p>It is desirable to adopt a calendar year or natural business year to know the results of business.</p>
<h2>Computation of Business Income</h2>
<p>To compute business income, following are the two methods &minus;</p>
<h3>Balance Sheet Approach</h3>
<p>Comparison of the closing values (Assets minus outsider’s liabilities) of a firm with the values at the beginning of that accounting period is called as Balance Sheet approach. In above value, an addition to capital will be subtracted and addition of drawings will be added while computing the business income of a firm. Since, income is calculated with the help of Balance Sheet hence called as Balance Sheet approach.</p>
<h3>Transaction Approach</h3>
<p>Transactions are mostly related to production or the purchase of goods and the sale of goods and all these transactions directly or indirectly related to the revenue or to the cost. Therefore, surplus collection of the revenue by selling goods, spent over for production or purchasing the goods is the measure of income. This system is widely followed by the enterprises where double entry system adopted.</p>
<h2>Measurement of Business Income</h2>
<p>There are following two factors which are helpful in the estimation of an income &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Revenues</b> &minus; Sale of goods and rendering of services are the way to generate revenue. Therefore, it can be defined as consideration, recovered by the business for rendering services and goods to its customers.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Expenses</b> &minus; An expense is an expired cost. We can say the cost that have been consumed in a process of producing revenue are the expired cost. Expenses tell us - how assets are decreased as a result of the services performed by a business.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Measurement of Revenue</h2>
<p>Measurement of the revenue is based on an accrual concept. Accounting period, in which revenue earned, is the period of revenue accrues. Therefore, a receipt of cash and revenue earned are the two different things. We can say that revenue is earned only when it is actually realized and not necessarily, when it is received.</p>
<h2>Measurement of Expenses</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>In case of delivery of goods to its customers is a direct identification with the revenue.</p></li>
<li><p>Rent and office salaries are an indirect association with the revenue.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are four types of events (given below) that need proper consideration about as an expense of a given period and expenditure and cash payment made in connection with those items &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Expenditure, which are expenses of the current year.</p></li>
<li><p>Some expenditure, which are made prior to this period and has become expense of the current year.</p></li>
<li><p>Expenditure, which is made this year, becomes expense in the next accounting periods. For example, purchase of fixed assets and depreciation in next up-coming years.</p></li>
<li><p>Expense of this year, which will be paid in next accounting years. For example, outstanding expenses.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Matching Concept</h2>
<p>It is a problem of recognition of revenue during the year and allocation of expired cost to the period.</p>
<h3>Recognition of Revenue</h3>
<p>Most frequent criteria, which are used in recognition of the revenue are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Point of Sale</b> &minus; Transfer of ownership title to a buyer is point of sale, in case of sale of commodity.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Receipt of Payment</b> &minus; Criteria of cash basis is widely used by the attorneys, physicians, and other professionals in which revenue is considered to be earned at the time of collection of cash.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Instalment Method</b> &minus; Instalment method is widely used in retail trading specially in consumer durables. In this system, revenue earned is treated in the same manner as is used in any other credit sale.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Gold Mines</b> &minus; The accounting period in which gold is mined is the period of revenue earned.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Contracts</b> &minus; Degree of contract completion, especially in long term construction contracts is based on percentage of completion of a contract in a single accounting year. It is based on total estimated life of the contract.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Allocation of Costs</h3>
<p>Matching of expired revenue and expired costs on a periodic time basis is the satisfactory basis of allocation of cost as stated earlier.</p>
<h2>Measurement of Costs</h2>
<p>Measurement of costs can be determined by &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Historical Costs</b> &minus; To determine periodic net income and financial status, historical cost is important. Historical cost actually means - outflow of cash or cash equivalents for goods and services acquired.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Replacement Costs</b> &minus; Replacing any asset at the current market price is called as replacement cost.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Basis of Measurement of Income</h2>
<p>Following are the two significant basis of measurement of income &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Accrual Basis</b> &minus; In an accrual basis accounting, incomes are recognized in a company’s books at the time when revenue is actually earned (however, not essentially received) and expenses is recorded when liabilities are incurred (however, not essentially paid for). Further, expenses are compared with revenues on the income statement when the expenses expire or title has been transferred to the buyer, and not at the time when the expenses are paid.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Cash Basis</b> &minus; In a cash basis accounting, revenues and expenses are recognized at the time of physical cash is actually received or paid out.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Change in the Basis of Accounting</h3>
<p>We have to pass adjustment entries whenever accounting records change from cash basis to accrual basis or vice versa specially in respect of the prepaid expenses, outstanding expenses, accrued income, income received in advance, bad debts &amp; provisions, depreciation, and stock in trade.</p>
<h3>Features of Accounting Income</h3>
<p>Followings are the main features of accounting income &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Matching revenue with related cost or expenses is a matter of accounting income.</p></li>
<li><p>Accounting income is based on an accounting period concept.</p></li>
<li><p>Expenses are measured in terms of a historical cost and determination of expenses is based on a cost concept.</p></li>
<li><p>It is based on a realization principal.</p></li>
<li><p>Revenue items are considered to ascertain a correct accounting income.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Financial Accounting - Inventory Valuation</h1>
<p>The Institute of Chartered Accountant of India as per Accounting Standard-2 (Revised) defines <b>inventory</b> as the assets held &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>For sale in the ordinary course of a business or</p></li>
<li><p>In the process of production for such a sale or</p></li>
<li><p>In the form of materials or supplies to be consumed in the production process or in rendering of the services.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the term inventory includes &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Raw Material and supplies,</li>
<li>Work in progress, and</li>
<li>Finished goods.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Importance of Inventory Valuation</h2>
<p>Proper valuation of inventory is important because of the following three reasons &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Importance of sufficient Inventory</b> &minus; An inventory represents major current asset investment of any trading or manufacturing concern. Shortage of inventory may close down the business. Realization of profit from resale of an inventory makes valuation of inventory. Therefore, the point is that every business unit has to follow a proper method of inventory valuation.</p></li>
<li><p><b>To Determine True Financial Position</b> &minus; Proper valuation of an inventory can only give true and fair view of the financial position of a business unit, as it constitutes a significant portion of the current assets.</p></li>
<li><p><b>For Proper Determination of Income</b> &minus; Proper determination of income and profit depends on correct valuation of the inventories. Over valuation of closing inventory may overstate the profit figure and vice-versa. Therefore, proper valuation of an inventory is necessary to determine the true income and profit by the business concern.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Methods of Taking Inventory</h2>
<p>Following are the two important methods of taking inventory &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Periodic Inventory Method and</li>
<li>Perpetual Inventory Method</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s discuss each of them separately &minus;</p>
<h3>Periodic Inventory Method</h3>
<p>This method of stock valuation is also known as physical stock taking method or annual stock taking method. Under this system of taking inventories, stock is determined by physical counting at the end of the accounting period i.e. the date of preparation of final accounts. This system is very simple and useful in small business organizations.</p>
<h3>Perpetual Inventory Method</h3>
<p>This system of inventory valuation records every movement of stock on the receipt and issue of material reflecting running balances of different kind of inventories through preparation of store ledgers for raw material, work-in- progress, and finished goods. To insure the accuracy of store records, a periodic reconciliation of records is done by taking physical inventories.</p>
<h2>Valuation of Inventory at Lower Cost or Market Price</h2>
<p>An inventory is valued at a cost or market price, whichever is lower to ensure that the anticipated profit should not be accounted for and full provision for anticipated losses should be done.</p>
<p><b>As per American Institute of Certified Public Accountants</b> &minus;</p>
<p><i>“A departure from the cost basis of pricing the inventory is required when the utility of the goods is no longer as great as its cost. Where there is evidence that the utility of goods, in their disposal in the ordinary course of business, will be less than cost, whether due to physical deterioration, obsolescence, changes in price levels, or other causes, the difference should be recognized as loss of the current period. This is generally accomplished by stating such goods at a lower level commonly designated as market.”</i></p>
<h2>Methods of Valuation of Inventory</h2>
<p>The following illustration shows the methods of Valuation of Inventory &minus;</p>
<img src="/financial_accounting/images/valuation_of_inventory_methods.jpg" alt="Valuation of Inventory Methods" />
<p>Let’s discuss each one of the methods in detail.</p>
<h3>First in First out (FIFO) Method</h3>
<p>FIFO is the most popular method of an inventory valuation, which is based on assumption that the material first received or purchased are the first to be sold or issued. It means, closing stock is out of the last or latest received or manufactured goods.</p>
<p>It will clear with a small and simple example as given below &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;">Date</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">No. of Item</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Rate</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Value</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Opening stock</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">100</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">10</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">1000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Purchased on 01-04-13</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">500</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">10</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">5000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Purchased on 01-07-13</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">500</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">12</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">6000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Purchased on 01-01-14</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">1000</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">15</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">15000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Total Purchases</td>
<td style="text-align:center;"><b>2100</b></td>
<td style="text-align:center;"></td>
<td style="text-align:center;"><b>27000</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Item Sold</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">1700</td>
<td style="text-align:center;"></td>
<td style="text-align:center;"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Closing stock</td>
<td style="text-align:center;"><b>400</b></td>
<td style="text-align:center;">15</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">6000</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>In above example, it is assumed that closing stock of 400 items was out 1000 items purchased on 01-01-2014.</p>
<h3>Last in First out (LIFO) Method</h3>
<p>As name suggests, closing stock is valued on the basis of oldest purchased or manufactured items. First time, this method was used by the U.S.A., at the time of Second World War to get the advantage of hike in prices. In the above example, closing stock will be valued at 400 items @ Rs. 10 each = Rs. 4000</p>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; Here 100 items from opening stock and 300 items were out of purchases made on 01-04- 2013</p>
<h3>Average Cost Method</h3>
<p>Average cost method is used where identification of stock with rate or value of stock is not possible. It is of two types Viz…</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Simple Average Price Method</li>
<li>Weighted Average Price Method</li>
</ul>
<h3>Simple Average Price Method</h3>
<p>Simple average price method may be explained as below &minus;</p>
<p>Suppose, four types of items are in stock as follows &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<td width="50%;">500 units purchased @ Rs. 10 per unit</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">= Rs. 5000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>750 units purchased @ Rs. 12 per unit</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">= Rs. 9000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>600 units purchased @ Rs. 14 per unit</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">= Rs. 8400</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Total Units 1850 for</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">= Rs. 22400</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Simple average method ignored the inventory at cost, therefore the valuation of stock of 1850 units will be = 12 &times; 1850 = Rs. 22,200 whereas the actual cost is Rs. 22,400</p>
<p>So, if we want to choose average method then weighted price method should be followed under which valuation will be done as hereunder.</p>
<h3>Weighted Average Price Method</h3>
<p>In the above example, Rs. 22,400 will be divided by 1850 units and the average price will be Rs. 12.1081.</p>
<h3>Highest in First out (HIFO) Method</h3>
<p>This method is based on the assumption that the highest value of material always consumed first and closing stock will be valued at the lowest cost of purchased or manufactured material. This method is not a popular method of valuation of inventory and so, used only by the business units having monopoly products or who are dealing with the cost + contract.</p>
<h3>Base Stock Method</h3>
<p>Base stock means — minimum level of stock maintained by a business unit to run his business without any interruption or which is according to <b>AS-2 issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India</b> as “<i>the base stock formula proceeds on the assumption that a minimum quantity of inventory (base stock) must be held at all times in order to carry on business</i>.”</p>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; This method can be followed only when LIFO method is used.</p>
<h3>Inflated Price Method</h3>
<p>This method of valuation covers normal losses, increasing price of purchases to calculate closing value of an inventory. For example, if 550 units purchased for Rs. 2000 and due to normal loss units, remain 500 then the cost per unit will be 2000/500 = Rs. 4 per unit, and while calculating closing stock value for 100 unit, cost will be Rs. 400 (100 &times; 4).</p>
<h3>Specific Identification Method</h3>
<p>Under this method, where identification of items with price is possible, then closing stock will be valued accordingly.</p>
<h3>Market Price Method</h3>
<p>Under this method of valuation, stock is valued at current market price. It is also called replacement price or realizable price method.</p>
<h3>Method of Valuation of Closing Stock when it is not given</h3>
<p>In case, where the value of closing stock is not given, we may calculate it as &minus;</p>
<table style="text-align:center;" class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<td width="50%;">Opening stock</td>
<td>xx</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Add: Net Purchases</td>
<td>xx</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Less: Cost of Sales</td>
<td>xx</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Less: Gross Profit</td>
<td>xx</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Value of Closing stock</td>
<td>xx</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Putting value in above formula, we may also calculate the value of opening stock.</p>
<h1>Analysis of Changes in Income</h1>
<p>The purpose of preparing a financial statement is not only to know the net income or losses of concern for the current year, but also to know the change in net income or losses of a firm in comparisons to the preceding years.</p>
<p>There are two types of financial statements, which reflect two types of profits i.e. <b>trading account</b> shows the gross profit and <b>Profit &amp; Loss accounts</b> shows the net profit of the concern for a specific accounting period. Under this chapter, we will discuss the reasons for changes in Gross Profit Ratio.</p>
<h2>Gross Profit Ratio (GPR)</h2>
<p>Gross profit means, excess of sales over cost of goods sold. This ratio also indicates the losses due to damage or mismanagement. More the ratio is high more it is good for a financial health of a concern. Chances of higher net income are more in an organization where ratio of gross profit is high (formula is given below) &minus;</p>
<p>$$\normalsize Gross\:Profit\:Ratio = \frac{Gross\:Profit}{Net\:Sales}$$</p>
<p>Higher gross profit provides leverage to the management to meet their indirect expenses and to spare net income for the distribution of profit and to increase the reserves.</p>
<h2>Gross Profit Margin</h2>
<p>When Gross profit margin is presented in percentage, it is called as Gross profit margin (formula is given below) &minus;</p>
<p>$$\normalsize Gross\:Profit\:Margin = \frac{Gross\:Profit}{Net\:Sales} \times 100$$</p>
<p><b>Chances of Increase in GPR may be due to following Reasons &minus;</b></p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Without increase in corresponding costs, if there is an increase in selling price.</p></li>
<li><p>Without decrease in selling price, if there is decrease in cost of production of products.</p></li>
<li><p>There may be equal decrease or increase in selling price and cost of production without affecting gross profit of the current year.</p></li>
<li><p>There may be chances that the valuations of closing stocks are done with higher price.</p></li>
<li><p>It is also possible that the opening stock of a concern is valued at very lower rate.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a possibility that given sales are inclusive of consignment sale due to any mistake or otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p>Omission of purchase invoices in the books of accounts may also be one of the reasons for higher gross profit.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Chances of Decrease in GPR may be due to following Reasons</b> &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>If cost price remains same, but decrease in selling price.</li>
<li>Sale price remains same, but increase in cost of production.</li>
<li>Personal used goods debited to purchase account.</li>
<li>Closing stock may be valued at very low price.</li>
<li>Opening stock may be valued at very high price.</li>
<li>Any omission or mistake while valuation of closing stock.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is necessary for survival and progress of any business to keep its margin of gross profit high as much as possible to enable it to cover its operative expenses as well as indirect expenses.</p>
<h2>Analysis of Gross Profit</h2>
<p>Analysis of changes in gross profit is the first step in determination of a net income. Change of gross profit in current year may be due to the following reasons &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Change in sale amount may be due to following three reasons &minus;
<ul class="list">
<li>Change in selling price.</li>
<li>Change in quantity sold without change in sale price.</li>
<li>Change in sale price as well as quantity of goods sold.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Change in cost of goods sold may be due to following reasons &minus;
<ul class="list">
<li>Change in cost of production.</li>
<li>Change quantity of goods sold.</li>
<li>Change in quantity as well as cost of goods sold.</li>

<h1>Accounting for Consignment</h1>
<p>Due to increasing size of market, it is quite obvious that manufacturers or whole sellers cannot approach directly to every customer around the state or nation. To overcome this limitation, manufacturers normally appoint reliable agents at every desired location to reach the customers directly. He makes an agreement with local traders who can sell goods on his behalf on commission basis.</p>
<h2>Meaning and Features of Consignment</h2>
<p>Consignment is a process under which the owner consigns/handovers his materials to his agent/salesman for the purpose of shipping, transfer, sale etc.</p>
<p>Following are the points that throw more light on the nature and scope of a consignment &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Here, ultimate ownership of the goods remains with the manufacturer or whole seller who handovers goods to his agent for sale on commission basis. Consignment is merely a transfer of possession of goods not an ownership.</p></li>
<li><p>Since ownership of goods remain with the manufacturer (consignor), consignee (agent) is not responsible for any loss or destruction of goods.</p></li>
<li><p>The goods are sold on owner’s risk and hence, profit/loss goes to owner.</p></li>
<li><p>Consignee only gets re-imbursement of expenses incurred by him and commission on sale made by him, because sale that proceeds, belongs to owner (consignor).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Why is Consignment not a Sale?</h2>
<p>Following are the reasons that explain why consignment is not a sale &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Ownership</b> &minus; Ownership of goods need to be transferred from seller to buyer in case of sale, but ownership of goods remains with the consignor, till the goods are sold by the consignee.</p></li>  
<li><p><b>Risk</b> &minus; In case of a consignment, normally, risk remains with the consignor in the event of goods being lost or destroyed.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Relationship</b> &minus; The relation between a seller and a buyer will be of debtor and creditor in case where goods are sold on credit basis. On the other hand, the relationship between a consignor and a consignee is that of principal and agent.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Goods Return</b> &minus; Usually, the sold goods cannot be returned back; however, if there is any manufacturing defect or any other technical fault, seller is obliged  to take them back. On the other hand, consignee may return the unsold stock of goods to consignor anytime.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Important Terms</h2>
<h3>Pro-forma Invoice</h3>
<p>Invoice implies that the sale has taken place, but pro-forma invoice is not an invoice. Proforma invoice is a statement prepared by the consignor of goods showing quantity, quality, and price of the goods. Such pro-forma invoice is issued by the consignor to consignee regarding the goods before the sale actually takes place.</p>
<h3>Account Sale</h3>
<p>Statement showing the details of goods received, goods sold, expenses incurred, commission charged, remittances made, and due balance is called Account Sale and it is remitted by the consignee to the consignor of goods on a periodic basis.</p>
<h3>Commission</h3>
<p>There are <b>three</b> types of commission payable to consignee on sale of the goods &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Simple Commission</b> &minus; This is usually a fixed percentage on the total sale, calculated as per mutually agreed terms.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Over-riding Commission</b> &minus; In case of an extra-ordinary sale of the goods, some specific amount is payable to consignee in the form of an incentive is called overriding commission. Over-riding commission is also calculated on the total sales.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Del-credere Commission</b> &minus; <i>“An agreement by which an agent or factor, in consideration of an additional premium or commission (called a del credere commission), engages, when he sells goods on credit, to insure, warrant, or guarantee to his principal the solvency of the purchaser, the engagement of the factor being to pay the debt himself if it is not punctually discharged by the buyer when it becomes due.”</i></p>
<p style="padding-left:65%;"><b>C. &amp; G. Merriam Co.</b></p></li>
</ul>
<p>A del credere commission is paid by the consignor to his agent for taking additional risk of recovery of debts from the consignee on an account of credit sales made by him (agent) on consignor's behalf.</p>
<h3>Direct Expenses</h3>
<p>Expenses, which increases the cost of the goods and are of non-recurring nature and incurred till the goods reach the warehouse of consignee may called direct expenses.</p>
<h3>Indirect Expenses</h3>
<p>Warehouse rent, storage charges, advertisement expenses, salaries, etc. comes under the category of the indirect expenses. The distinctions between direct and indirect expenses are important especially at the time of valuation of the unsold closing stock.</p>
<h3>Advance</h3>
<p>Amount paid in advance by a consignee to consigner as security called as advance.</p>
<h2>Valuation of unsold Consignment</h2>
<p>Valuation of unsold stock will be done like a closing stock of a Trading concern and should be valued at the cost or the market price whichever is low. This stock will be valued at &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Proportionate cost price and</li>
<li>Proportionate direct expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, proportionate direct expenses mean — all expenses incurred by the consignor and the expenses of consignee, which are incurred by him till the goods reach the warehouse.</p>
<h2>Invoicing Goods higher than Cost</h2>
<p>Under this method, goods are charged at the cost + profit and the pro-forma invoice also shows this higher price of such goods. To know the actual profit, at the end of an accounting period, consignment account will be credited with excess price so charged. Value of the stock will also be adjusted to the extent of profit element. Main reason to adopt this policy by consignor is &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>To hide actual profit from consignee.</p></li>
<li><p>Valuation of a stock at the consignor’s warehouse is comparatively easy in this case.</p></li>
<li><p>In this case, consignor usually directs consignee to sale goods on invoice price only. It prevents different sale price to different customers.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Loss of Goods</h2>
<p>There may be two types of losses as explained below &minus;</p>
<p><b>Normal Loss</b> &minus; Normal loss may occur due to inherent characteristics of goods like evaporation, drying up of goods, etc. It is not separately shown in the consignment account, but included in the cost of goods sold and the closing stock by inflating the rate per unit. To calculate the value of unsold stock, following formula is used.</p>
<p>$$\small Value\:of\:closing\:stock = \frac{Total\:value\:of\:goods\:sent}{Net\:quantity\:received\:by\:consignee} \times Unsold\:quantity$$</p>
<p>$$\small Net\:quantity\:received = Goods\:consigned\:quantity - Normal\:loss\:quantity$$</p>
<p><b>Abnormal Loss</b> &minus; An abnormal loss may occur due to any accidental reason. It is credited to the consignment account to calculate actual profitability. Valuation of closing stock is done on the same basis as explained earlier i.e. proportionate cost + proportionate direct expenses.</p>
<h3>Abnormal Loss and Insurance</h3>

<h1>Financial Accounting - Joint Venture</h1>
<p>An association of two or more persons or we may say temporary partnership combined for the carrying out a specific business, and divide profit or loss thereof in agreed ratio is called a <b>Joint Venture</b>. Concerned parties to joint venture are known as co-venturers. The liabilities of co-venturers are limited to their profit sharing ratio or as per agreed terms &minus;</p>
<p>Suppose ‘A’ and ‘B’ undertake the job to develop a park for a consideration of Rs. 50,000/- Lacs. Since they come together for a work on a specific project, it will termed as joint venture and each of them (A and B) will be called as a co-venturer. Further, this venture will automatically terminate once the project is completed.</p>
<h2>Major Features and Characteristics of Joint Venture</h2>
<p>Following are the major features of a joint venture &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>There is an agreement between two or more persons.</p></li>
<li><p>Joint venture is made for the specific execution of a business plan/project.</p></li>
<li><p>It is a temporary partnership without the use of a firm name.</p></li>
<li><p>Agreement for joint ventures is automatically dissolved as soon as specific project is over.</p></li>
<li><p>Profit &amp; Share are shared on the same terms and conditions agreed upon. However, in the absence of any agreement, profit &amp; share will be divided equally.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Partnership and Joint Venture</h2>
<p>There are following differences between partnership and joint venture &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Partnership always carried on with firm’s name, but for the joint venture, no such firm’s name is required.</p></li>
<li><p>The persons who run the business on partnership are called as partners and the persons who agreed to take the project as joint venture are called as co-venturers.</p></li>
<li><p>Normally, a partnership is constituted for a long period (including various projects), whereas joint venture is formed to complete a specific job/project.</p></li>
<li><p>Partnership is governed under the Partnership Act, 1932, whereas there is no enactment of such kind for the joint ventures. However, as a matter of fact in law, a joint venture is treated as a partnership.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no limit specified for the numbers of co-venturers, but the number of partners is limited to 10 under banking business and 20 for any other trade or business.</p></li>
<li><p>Liability of a partner is unlimited and may extent of his business and personal estate, whereas under joint venture, liabilities of co-venturers are limited to the particular assignment or project agreed upon.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Joint Venture and Consignment</h2>
<p>Major differences between joint venture and consignment may be summarized as &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Relationship</b> &minus; The co-venturers of a Joint venture are the owners of a Joint venture, whereas relationship of a consignor and consignee is of owner and Agent.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Sharing of Profits</b> &minus; There is no distribution of profit between a consignor and consignee, consignee only gets commission on sale made by him. On the other hand, the co-venturers of a joint venture share profits as per the agreed profit sharing ratio.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Ownership of Goods</b> &minus; Ownership of the goods remains with the consignor. Consignor transfers only possession to the consignee, but every co-venturer of a joint venture is the co-owner of the goods/project.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Contribution of Funds</b> &minus; Investment is done by the consignor only. On the other hand, funds are contributed by all co-ventures in a certain agreed proportion.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Continuity of Business</b> &minus; In case of a joint venture, there is no continuity of the business once project is completed. On the other hand, if, everything goes smooth, consignment is a continuous process.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Accounting Records</h2>
<p>To keep a record of the joint venture transactions, there are three following types of accounting methods &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>When one of the Venturers keeps Accounts,</li>
<li>When Separate Books of Accounts are kept for the Joint Venture, and</li>
<li>When Separate Books of Accounts are not kept for the Joint Venture.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s discuss each of them separately &minus;</p>
<h2>When one of the Venturers keeps Accounts</h2>
<p>If one of the co-venturers is appointed to manage the joint venture, he is awarded an extra commission or remuneration out of the profit for his services.</p>

<h2>When Separate Books of Accounts are kept for the Joint Venture</h2>
<p>Under this method, all co-venturers contribute their share of investment and deposit their shares in a Joint Bank account — newly opened for the specific purpose of the Joint Venture. They may use this bank account to make any kind of payments and to deposit sale proceeds or any other kind of receipts.</p>
<p>In addition to Bank account, a Joint venture account is also opened in the books to keep records of all transactions routed through this account.</p>
<p>This category of accounts is a personal account of the each co-venturer. Thus following three accounts are opened &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Joint Bank Account</li>
<li>Joint Venture Account</li>
<li>Personal account of co-venturers</li>
</ul>
<h3>When Separate Books of Accounts are not kept for the Joint Venture</h3>
<p>It is of two types &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>When all venturers keep separate accounts</li>
<li>Memorandum joint venture method</li>
</ul>
<p><b>When all Venturers keep Separate Accounts</b> &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Separate Joint venture account and personal accounts of other co-venturers are opened under this method of accounting.</p></li>
<li><p>Joint venture account is debited and bank account or creditor account is credited on the account of goods purchased or expensed.</p></li>
<li><p>Joint venture account is credited and a bank account or debtor account is debited in case of either cash sale or credit sale.</p></li>
<li><p>Each co-venturer debits joint venture account and credits personal accounts of other co-venturer on the account of either goods purchased or expensed by other co-venturers.</p></li>
<li><p>Joint venture account is credited and personal account of others co-venturer account is debited in case of sale made by other co-venturers.</p></li>
<li><p>Joint venture account is debited and commission account is credited if, commission is receivable, but if commission is receivable by other co-venturer, then the concerned co-venturer account will be credited instead of the commission account.</p></li>
<li><p>If unsold stock is taken, then goods account will be debited by crediting Joint venture account. On the other hand, if unsold stock is taken by any other co-venturer, then personal account of the co-venturer will be debited.</p></li>
<li><p>Balance in the joint venture accounts represents profit or loss and later that amount of profit or loss will be transferred to the personal accounts of co-venturers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; Above transactions are possible only when all the co-venturers exchange information’s on regular basis.</p>
<p><b>Memorandum Joint Venture Method</b></p>
<p>Important features of memorandum method are given as hereunder &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Only one personal account is opened by each co-venturer in his book named Joint Venture account with…………… (Name of other co-venturer). Same process will be followed by other co-venturer in his books of accounts.</p></li>
<li><p>Only one personal account will be opened by each co-venturer irrespective of the fact, how many other co-venturers are exists. For example, there is a joint venture of 4 person A,B,C, &amp; D; now, A in his books will open only one personal account named as <b><i>Joint venture with B,C, &amp; D account</i></b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Each party will record only those transactions in his book, which are done by him; the transactions done by other co-venturers will be ignored.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition to above said personal account, a combined account named as “memorandum joint venture account” will also be opened.</p></li>
<li><p>Memorandum account is merely a combined account of personal accounts opened by each co-venturer. Debit side of personal account will be transferred to the memorandum account and the credit side of personal account will be transferred to the credit side of memorandum account.</p></li>
<li><p>Transactions done by co-venturers among themselves including cash received or paid by one co-venturer to other will be ignored at the time of preparation of a memorandum account.</p></li>
<li><p>Balance of memorandum joint venture account will represent profit or loss of the particular business. Further, the profit or loss will be transferred to the individual co-venturer account in their profit sharing ratio.</p></li>

<h1>Financial Accounting - Non-Trading Accounts</h1>
<p>Some of the organizations or institutions are constituted to provide valuable services to the society with the objective not to earn profit. These organizations normally offer the services such as education, medical, social clubs, charitable trusts, trade unions, etc.</p>
<p>However, we can summarize these organizations in the following three types of categories &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Clubs, associations, or society’s works for the welfare of their members.</p></li>
<li><p>Charitable institutions like hospitals, students’ hostels, and other educational institutions providing education to poor children as well as illiterate young and old groups.</p></li>
<li><p>Professional firms of lawyers, chartered accountants, architects, doctors, solicitors, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>What is Non-Trading Account?</h2>
<p>Maintenance of proper books of accounts is necessary to safeguard the money of its members and general public from any kind of misuse or misappropriations. It is important to know the total receipts, total payments, and also to know financial status of an institution. Hence, the account opened and maintained for and by the organizations discussed above is known as Non-trading account.</p>
<p>Normally, registration of members, minute book, cash receipt journal, cash payment journal, etc. are main record which is maintained by these organizations/ institutions in their non-trading accounts. At the end of an accounting period, these institutions prepares its final accounts, which include the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Receipt and Payment Account</li>
<li>Income and Expenditure Account</li>
<li>Balance-Sheet</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s discuss each of these in detail.</p>
<h2>Receipt and Payment Account</h2>
<p>It is a real account. Basic rule of double entries is followed to prepare this account. It is prepared from a cash book at the end of the accounting period. Every transaction regarding the cash transactions is recorded in the Cash Book in a chronological order. We may say that the Receipt and Payment account is a summary of cash payment and cash receipts during the current year.</p>
<p>For example, if rent and salary paid on monthly basis all over the accounting period, and donation or subscription received during the current year recorded in a cash book date wise, but at the end of the accounting period, the Receipt and Payment account will contain total amount of rent paid, salary paid, subscription received and donation received. All cash receipt will be recorded on the debit side and all cash payment will be recorded on the credit side.</p>
<h2>Income and Expenditure Account</h2>
<p>Income and expenditure account is a nominal account and as an equivalent to Profit and Loss account.</p>
<p>The essential features of an income and expenditure account are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Expenses and losses are recorded in the debit side of it and all incomes and gains are recorded on the credit side.</p></li>
<li><p>Capital income and expenditure are excluded and revenue income and expenses are included in it.</p></li>
<li><p>It is based on a mercantile system of accounting, therefore, the income and expenses related to preceding years or subsequent years are excluded while preparing the income and expenditure account.</p></li>
<li><p>The credit balance of an income and expenditure account shows surplus. Further, excess of income over the expenditure and the debit balance of it show deficit i.e. excess of the expenditure over income.</p></li>
<li><p>Only nominal accounts are considered in preparation of this account.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Balance Sheet</h2>
<p>The date on which a balance sheet is prepared, particulars of all the assets and liabilities are recorded in the same manner as we do in any other profit making firms. Its capital fund is made up of surplus income over expenditure and other incomes capitalized in the given period of time. Sometimes, two balance sheets need to be prepared viz…</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>At the beginning of the accounting year to know the opening capital fund and</li>
<li>At the end of the financial year to know the financial position of the organization.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conversion of Receipt and Payment Account into Income and Expenditure Account</h2>
<p>Following are the steps required to convert receipt and payment account into income &amp; expenditure account &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Opening balance and closing balance of a receipt and payment account representing opening cash in hand, opening cash at bank, closing cash in hand, and closing cash at bank need to be ignored.</p></li>
<li><p>Items of capital receipts and capital payment will be excluded while preparing an income and expenditure account.</p></li>
<li><p>Revenue items of an income and expenditure will be considered only at the time of preparation of an income &amp; expenditure account from the receipt and payment account.</p></li>
<li><p>All adjustment regarding the outstanding expenses, prepaid expenses, provision for bad debts, provision for depreciation, income received in advance, and income receivable will be done.</p></li>
<li><p>An income and expenditure relating to preceding year or subsequent year will be ignored, and the items only related to the current year will be considered.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Method to Calculation</h3>
<p>With the help of ledger accounts, we may calculate the value of income or expenses.</p>
<p>The following two examples describe the method of calculation &minus;</p>
<p><b>Example (1)</b> &minus; to calculate the amount of expenses of the current year, we need to prepare a ledger account of a particular expense and then the balancing figure of it will represent the amount of expense for the current year.</p>
<p>From the following particulars, please find out the amount of rent need to be shown in income &amp; expenditure account &minus;</p>

<p>It is very clear from the above example that the balancing figure represents rent for the current year i.e. to be transferred and shown in the debit side of the income &amp; expenditure account. Following the same method, we can calculate the amount of any other expenses.</p>
<h2>Items Peculiar to Non-Trading Concern</h2>
<p>There are certain peculiar items in the case of non-trading concerns, which require a special treatment &minus;</p>
<h3>Donations</h3>
<p>Non-trading concerns may receive donations time to time. The treatment of donation depends upon nature of donation.</p>
<p>There are two types of donation as explained below &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Specific Donation</b> &minus; Some donation may be received for any specific purpose, for example, for the construction of a room or building and then donation is termed as specific donation. The amount of such donation cannot be used for any other purpose. It should be shown on liabilities side of the Balance-sheet and used only for the same purpose it is meant for.</p></li>
<li><p><b>General Donation</b> &minus; When a donation is received for a common purpose is termed as General Donation. If the amount of donation is small, it will be treated as recurring income and will be recorded in the credit side of income &amp; expenditure account.</p>
<p>Donation of the big amount should be fairly treated as capital receipts and will be shown in the liabilities side of the Balance sheet. However, donation is of a small amount or a big amount may depend upon the size of a concern and amount.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Legacy</h3>
<p>Sometimes, as per the will of a person, an amount received is called as legacy. It is as good as donation. It is of a non-recurring nature, therefore should be treated as a capital receipt, and hence will be appeared in the liabilities side of a Balance sheet. However, it may also be treated as an income and may be taken to income &amp; expenditure account.</p>
<h3>Entrance Fees</h3>
<p>A club or society usually charge admission fees or entrance fees for the membership. In case of club etc., admission fees or entrance fees usually charged as capital receipts, but in case of a hospital or educational institution, it is treated as a recurring income.</p>
<h3>Life Membership Fees</h3>
<p>The life membership fees may be taken from the members of institution only once in their lifetimes. On the basis of lifetime membership, members may enjoy certain benefits. Amount received as the Life Membership might be transferred to the “Life Membership Fees Account” of the institution and can be dealt in the accounts by any of the following methods &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>May be taken as liabilities side of a Balance sheet as Life Membership Fees.”</p></li>
<li><p>Normal subscriptions of the members may be transferred from the Life Membership Fees account to the subscription account as an income and the balance may be carried forward to the following years.</p></li>
<li><p>On the basis of average life of a member, the amount may be transferred to the income and expenditure account annually and rest will be carried forward towards the following years.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Sale of Scrap or Old Newspapers</h3>
<p>Without any dispute, it will be treated as recurring income and will appear in the credit side of an income and expenditure account.</p>
<h3>Subscription</h3>
<p>Subscription is the major source of an income for the non-trading concerns. Subscriptions are received from the members of a club or institution. A receipt and payment account records all the actual subscription received during the current year and an income &amp; expenditure account shows the subscriptions, which relates to the current accounting period. Therefore, some adjustments require to calculate the subscription of the current year.</p>
<p><b>Example (1)</b> &minus; to calculate the amount of Subscription for the current year, the ledger account of a subscription account needs to be drawn and the balancing figure of this will represent the amount of subscription of the current year.</p>
<p>With the following particulars, please find out the amount of subscription to be shown in an income &amp; expenditure account &minus;</p>

<p>It is very clear from the above example that the balancing figure represents subscription for the current year, which needs to be transferred to the income &amp; expenditure account as an income.</p>
<h3>Special Funds</h3>
<p>Some special funds are created by the respective institutions for specific purpose. For example, a prize fund may be created to give the best player of the year award. Any income relating to those funds should be added to the funds and deficit, if any may be charged from the income &amp; expenditure account.</p>
<p><b>Example (2)</b> &minus; to calculate the amount of an income related to the current year, we need to prepare a ledger account of the particular income. Further, the balancing figure of this account will represent the amount of an income for the current year.</p>

<h1>Financial Accounting - Single Entry</h1>
<p>As we know, there are two systems of recording transactions in our books of accounts. In the previous chapters, we have learned about the double entry system, now let’s discuss another system of accounting i.e. <b>S</b>ingle <b>E</b>ntry <b>S</b>ystem (<b>SES</b>).</p>
<h2>Meaning and Silent Features of SES</h2>
<p>For every accounting transaction, everyone does not follow the principle of double entry system of accounts. Some of the small business units do not keep their books of accounts as per double entry system. In simple words, single entry system of accounts mean — the business unit, which does not follow the principle of double entry system.</p>
<p>There are following two types of SES of accounts &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Pure Single Entry System</b> &minus; Personal accounts like sundry debtors and sundry creditor’s accounts are maintained, but real and nominal accounts are not opened under this system.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Popular Sense</b> &minus; Under this system, three types of treatment are done.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Double entry system followed for cash received from the debtors and the cash paid to the creditors.</p></li>
<li><p>Single entry system followed for expenses paid, purchases of goods, purchases of fixed assets etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Provisional entries like bad debts, depreciation, etc. are not done.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Difference between SES and DES</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Single entry is an in-complete system of accounting, whereas double entry system (<b>DES</b>) is a complete system of accounting transactions.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no reliability on books in a single entry system, whereas double entry system is a reliable accounting system.</p></li>
<li><p>Checking of the arithmetical accuracy is possible in a double entry system through preparation of trial balance, whereas it is not possible under a single entry system.</p></li>
<li><p>Since, single entry system does not maintain Trading, and Profit &amp; Loss Account, and Balance Sheet; hence, ascertainment of the actual profit and exact financial position of the firms is not possible, on the other hand, all above is quite possible under the double entry system of accounting.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Limitations of SES</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Single entry system of accounts do not record two-fold aspects of each and every transactions, hence, it is not a scientific system of keeping accounting records.</p></li>
<li><p>Checking of the arithmetical accuracy is not possible due to non-preparation of a trial balance. Preparation of a trial balance is not possible, because the method of double entry system is not followed for each business transaction.</p></li>
<li><p>Ascertainment of the actual profit of a concern is not possible, as nominal accounts are kept under single entry system. In the absence of nominal accounts, Trading and Profit & Loss account cannot be prepared.</p></li>
<li><p>It is not possible to find the exact financial position of a firm in the absence of real accounts, because without real accounts, it is not possible to prepare the Balance sheet of a firm on a particular day.</p></li>
<li><p>Outsiders never rely on the books of accounts of a firm.</p></li>
<li><p>In case where owner of the business wants to sell his business, ascertainment of exact value of the business is not possible, especially goodwill value of the firm.</p></li>
<li><p>Single entry system is practiced only by the small business units.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Preparation of Statement of Affairs</h2>
<p>To know the financial position of a business, the list of assets &amp; liabilities and statement of affairs are prepared on the last date of accounting period. As stated earlier, in the absence of real accounts, it is not possible to prepare a Balance sheet.</p>
<p>Following points are required to prepare the statement of affairs &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>With the help of personal accounts, a list of debtors and creditors should be prepared.</p></li>
<li><p>Stock valuation method will be either on cost or market price, whichever is lower.</p></li>
<li><p>Cash book balance should be physically verified with the cash book.</p></li>
<li><p>Bank balance should also be reconciled with the Bank statements.</p></li>
<li><p>Statement of affairs should contain the income received in advance and the expenses paid in advance.</p></li>
<li><p>Excess of assets over liabilities will be capital of the proprietor or firm.</p></li>
<li><p>Basis for the valuation of fixed assets will be the purchased voucher and any other available evidence.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>How does the Statement of affairs Differ from Balance-Sheet?</h3>
<p>Main difference between the statement of affairs and the Balance sheet is —reliability on first is prepared through incomplete information and on later is based on the scientific method of the double entry system of accounts.</p>
<h2>Ascertainment of Profit under SES</h2>
<p>We have the following two methods to ascertain the profit under single entry system &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Statement of Affairs or Net worth Method and</li>
<li>Conversion Method</li>
</ul>
<h3>Net worth Method</h3>
<p>Under the single entry system, the ascertainment of the profit can be done without preparing a Trading and Profit &amp; Loss account. For example,</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<td class="ts" width="10%;">1</td>
<td>To know the capital at the beginning of the year or at the last date of the preceding accounting year, first step is to prepare the statement of affairs at the beginning of the year.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">2</td>
<td>One statement of affairs should be prepared on the last date of accounting year to ascertain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">3</td>
<td>Drawing should be added to the amount of capital as ascertained at the end of the year and the capital introduced if, any, during the year will be subtracted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;">4</td>
<td>Capital introduced if, any, during the year will be subtracted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">5</td>
<td>Difference of (3) – (1) will be the profit or loss for the year. If, (3) is more than (1), then it is a profit or vice versa.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">6</td>
<td>The amount of profit or loss as calculated by the step No. (4) above, will be adjusted by the interest on capital and the interest on drawing (to ascertain Net Profit of the firm).</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Conversion Method</h3>
<p>Under the conversion method system of accounting, change from the single entry system to the double entry system on a particular date can be done by the following procedure &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Statement of affairs should prepare on the date on which the change need to be made. After the proper checking and verification of such balances from available records, all the balances like cash balance, bank balance, assets, liabilities, debtors, and creditors should appear in the statement of affairs.</p></li>
<li><p>An opening journal entry should be made to bring into the books as &minus;</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Journal Entry</b></p>

</table>
<p>Above entry will be a base entry to open all new books under the double entry system of accounts and all the future transactions will be booked according to the double entry system as explained earlier.</p>
<h3>Conversion of Books of Last Year from SES into DES</h3>
<p>To convert books of the last year from single entry to double entry system, it will be assumed that all the subsidiary books are maintained properly under the single entry system. However, following procedures need to be followed &minus;</p>
<p><b>Where Cash Book, Personal Books, and Subsidiary Books are Maintained &minus;</b></p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Opening statement of the affairs should be prepared at the beginning of the period.</p></li>
<li><p>All the impersonal accounts as appeared in the cash book should be posted in the respective impersonal accounts, if it has not been done earlier.</p></li>
<li><p>New impersonal accounts need to be opened through total of the subsidiary books. For example, with the total of sales book and purchase book, sale account will be credited and purchase account will be debited, vice versa in case of returns.</p></li>
<li><p>All the new account should be opened for the entries relating to discount, rebates, bad debts, etc. which are not passed through the subsidiary books. This procedure will give two-folds effect of such transaction as appeared in the personal accounts.</p></li>
<li><p>Month-wise positing should be done to the ledger accounts through petty cash book, if, maintained by the firm.</p></li>
<li><p>After completion of the above procedure, a trial balance should be prepared to confirm the arithmetical accuracy of the books of accounts.</p></li>
<li><p>After completion of the above procedure of trial balance,  Trading and Profit & Loss account and Balance sheet should be prepared (after considering all the adjustments like prepaid expenses, outstanding expenses, income received in advance, or receivables as well as the provisions for depreciations, doubtful debts etc.</p></li>

<h1>Financial Accounting - Leasing</h1>
<p>In the field of real estate, leasing is a popular term because it is advantageous to own land and building. Today, most of the businesses run their offices on the leased premises.</p>
<p>A <b>Lease</b> is an agreement under which lessee (the person/entity, who takes possession of the property) get the right to use the premises for the agreed period of time in lieu of the rent as agreed between both Lessor (owner) and lessee. Lessor has an ownership right of assets, but still lessee has an unrestricted right to use that asset.</p>

<ul class="list">
<li><p>Period of lease.</p></li>
<li><p>Timing of the payment to be made along with the amount of rent.</p></li>
<li><p>About maintenance expenses, taxes, insurance, provision for renewal of lease agreement.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Accounting Standard 19, issued by the Council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, covers the disclosure of appropriate accounting policies in the financial statements.</p>
<p>Standards 19 are mandatory in nature and applicable to all lease agreements except some given below &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Lands to be used under the lease agreement.</li>
<li>For use of natural resources like oil, gas, timber, metal, etc.</li>
<li>Video recording, films, motion picture, patents, and copyrights.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Important Terms in Leasing</h2>
<p>Following important terms are commonly used in lease accounting &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Lessee</b> &minus; Lessee is a person who possess the right to use the asset in lieu of agreed rent for a certain period of time (as per the lease agreement).</p></li>
<li><p><b>Lessor</b> &minus; Lessor is the owner who gives right to the lessee to use his asset/property in lieu of rent for a certain period of time.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Lease Term</b> &minus; Usually, lease agreement is contracted for a fixed and non-cancellable period called as lease term. It is also known as ‘Lease Period.’ Lease term may be further extended as agreed with or without further amendment/s.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Fair Value</b> &minus; Fair value is an amount on which an asset can be exchanged or it may be the value of liability settled.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Useful Life</b> &minus; It can be</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A period over which an asset could be used by the lessee.</p></li>
<li><p>Expected number of units that can be produced by that asset.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><b>Inception of Lease</b> &minus; It is the date on which principal provision of the lease are committed to.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Unguaranteed Residual Value</b> &minus; An expected fair value at the end of the lease period is called as Unguaranteed Residual Value.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Popularity of Leasing</h2>
<p>One of the main reasons behind the popularity of leasing is its simplicity to both the parties i.e. lessor as well as lessee. It is beneficial in terms of its documentation and also provides tax advantage. Selection and purchase of asset come under the purview of leasing company, and use and rent payment of the assets are the part of lessee.</p>
<p>Since lessor remains owner of the assets, so he can claim for the depreciation in his books. Interestingly, he can enjoy the tax benefit against the depreciation. Similarly, lessee pays the rent and records such rent in his books as expenses for the purpose of tax benefit.</p>
<h2>Advantages of Leasing</h2>
<p>Main advantage of leasing is given hereunder &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Lessee can use the asset without actually purchasing it, means full finance without any margin money.</p></li>
<li><p>It provides flexibility in fixation of the rent and the lease period as per the requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Balance sheet of a lessee, leased assets are not shown as asset or liability of the company, hence the credit capacity of the lessee remains un-affected.</p></li>
<li><p>Leasing provides an opportunity to lessee to earn additional profit and to improve earnings per share.</p></li>
<li><p>Deduction of a rent is eligible to claim tax benefit (as business expenditure).</p></li>
<li><p>Without heavy investment, lease rent can be paid out from the income generated by the use of the assets.</p></li>
<li><p>Tax benefit of the depreciation may be claimed by lessor according to the Income Tax Act.</p></li>
<li><p>Taking advantage of the full utilization of the asset is possible under a lease agreement; chances of ignorance are high, where company purchases asset as its own.</p></li>
<li><p>In case of a closely held company, it provides better wealth planning solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>It provides protection to lessee against the inflation.</p></li>
<li><p>Strict provisions of the financial institutions for acquiring an asset can be avoided through a lease agreement.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Disadvantages of Leasing</h2>
<p>Some of the disadvantages of leasing are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Leasing is not very much useful for some of the new businesses, as earning through the business comes much after the investment.</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the incentives as provided by the state and the central government, cannot be enjoyed due to lease agreement.</p></li>
<li><p>The assets, whose values are likely to appreciate, should be purchased instead of leasing.</p></li>
<li><p>In case of variation clause in a lease agreement, rental structure can be changed due to change in the rate of interest, rate of depreciation, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Classification of Lease</h2>
<p>According to AS-19, following are the two categories of Leasing &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Operating lease</li>
<li>Finance Lease</li>
</ul>
<h3>Operating Lease</h3>
<p>Operating lease is an agreement wherein the lessor (owner) allows the renter (lessee) to use the agreed asset for a particular period. Usually, the lease period is shorter than the economic life of the asset. Further, lessor does not actually transfer the ownership rights. The Lessor gives the right to the lessee to use the asset in return of regular payments for an agreed period of time.</p>
<h3>Accounting Treatment</h3>
<p>As per AS-19, following are the accounting treatment in the books of lessor and lessee &minus;</p>
<p>In the books of Lessor &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Assets should be treated as the fixed assets in the Balance sheet of a lessor.</p></li>
<li><p>Rental income should be treated as an income in the Profit and Loss account.</p></li>
<li><p>Depreciation should be treated as expenses and should be debited from the Profit &amp; Loss account.</p></li>
<li><p>An initial cost can be deferred to the lease period of the asset or may be booked as expenses in the year, in which actually incurred.</p></li>
<li><p>Depreciation will be charged as per AS-6.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the books of Lessee &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Lessee should treat a rental payment as expenses in the profit and loss account.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Finance Lease</h3>
<p>In case where lease is able to secure for lessor the recovery of his capital outlays plus a reasonable return on the fund invested during the lease period is called financing lease. Finance lease in non-cancellable contract and also, lessor is not responsible for any expenses and taxes of the leased asset.</p>
<h3>Accounting Treatment</h3>
<p>In the books of Lessor &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Total value of the investment plus income receivable on it will be treated as receivables in the Balance sheet.</p></li>
<li><p>Direct expenses may be directly debited from the profit and Loss account in the year of expenses incurred or may be deferred up to the lease period.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the books of Lessee &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Initial direct cost will be treated as an asset.</p></li>
<li><p>Fair value of the leased assets should be considered as an asset and a liability in the finance lease.</p></li>
<li><p>It is an appropriate to show liability separately in the Balance sheet.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Financial Accounting - Investment Account</h1>
<p>Anyone can buy and sell securities from a stock exchange with the purpose to increase his/her (monetary) assets. Sale and purchase of the securities is done through banks. The stockbrokers help people in trading by paying the amount of commission, stamp duty, and brokerage on it, which are the essential parts of security trading.</p>
<p>At the time of selling of these securities, charges should be deducted from the sale, as proceeds to get the actual sale price. Most of the time, market price is different from the face value of securities, which depends upon different regulating factors. If market value of the securities is equal to face value, it is called as <b><i>at par</i></b>; if market value is less than face value, it is called as <b><i>on discount</i></b>; and if market value is higher than face value, it is said to be <b><i>on premium</i></b>.</p>
<h2>Meaning of Investment</h2>
<p>Investment means either buying or creating an asset with the future expectation of capital appreciation, dividends (profit), rents, interest earnings, or some combination of these returns. However, normally, investment inherent with some form of risk, such as investment in equities, property, and even fixed interest securities, among other things, are the subject to inflation risk.</p>
<p>Further, among all these, securities are held as long term investment to earn income. It is said to be fixed assets, but where objective of an organization is to sell and buy securities in short term fund to utilize its surplus fund, would come under the category of current assets.</p>
<p>There may be two types of securities &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Fixed Interest Securities</b> &minus; Holders of fixed interest securities get fixed rate of interest.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Variable Yield Securities</b> &minus; Under this category, return on investment may differ from year to year.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Investment Account</h2>
<p>Investment account is an account opened for the purpose of the investment. Further, if the number of investment is large, a separate account for each investment should be opened.</p>
<p>Accounting entry on the purchase of any investments are given as hereunder &minus;</p>

<h2>Investment Transactions</h2>
<p>We normally have the following two types of investments transactions &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Cum Dividend or Cum Interest Quotations and </li>
<li>Ex-Dividend or Ex-Interest Quotations</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s discuss these two types of investment transactions in detail.</p>
<h3>Cum Dividend or Cum Interest Quotations</h3>
<p>Interest and dividend on the fixed investments accrued on regular interval, but payment of those are made only on fixed dates. Dividends are always paid to the persons, who are shareholder at the time of payouts. Suppose a shareholder sold his shares after keeping those shares in his hand up to ten months, then dividends on those shares will be paid to the buyer or we can say, to new shareholder.</p>
<p>So, a seller at the time of selling shares normally charge value of the accrued dividends up to the date of sale, and this is called ‘CUM DIVIDEND” or “CUM INTEREST”. Since, the sale price is inclusive of the value of a share and interest or dividend, therefore at the time of entry in the books of accounts, normal price of share should be booked in the investment account and the value of dividend or interest should be debited to dividend or interest account.</p>
<p>At the time of receiving dividend or interest, dividend or interests account will be credited, debiting cash or bank account. On the other hand, in the books of seller, normal price of the share should be credited to Investment account and the price of accrued dividend or interest should be credited to the dividend or interest account as the case may be.</p>

<h3>Ex-Dividend or Ex-Interest Quotations</h3>
<p>The buyer of shares when he is quoted ex-dividend is not entitled to receive the payment. It is the interval between the <b>record date</b> and the <b>payment date</b> during which the stock trades without its dividend. Therefore, the person who owns the security on the <b>ex-dividend date</b> will be awarded the payment, regardless of who currently holds the stock.</p>

<h1>Accounts of Private Individuals</h1>
<p>Most of the private individuals never keep their accounts to record earned income or expenditure incurred by them. It is advisable for everyone to maintain an account to know what he has earned during a particular period, what he spent, and what was his saving out of that income. It is helpful to track the record of income and expenditure. It also helps to increase the income (as need arises) and control on the expenditure.</p>
<h2>Maintenance of Accounts by Private Individuals</h2>
<p>Private individual should keep his books on cash basis system, ignoring accrued system in different heads like insurance premium paid, medical insurance, school fees, taxes, household expenses, medical expenses, clothing, salary received, bank interest, income from mutual fund, rent received, and other income received.</p>
<p>For all these, one should keep a cash book, which can be summarized on monthly basis as per the abstract of cash Book given below &minus;</p>

<p>In case of professional individual, one more column can be added in the cash book to show professional transaction and personal transaction separately. In addition to above, an individual may keep a register to maintain the record for his assets including car, building, investments, etc.</p>
<h2>Maintenance of Accounts by Professionals</h2>
<p>A cash basis of accounting is the most suitable system for any professional including doctor, accountant, or solicitor instead of a mercantile system to fulfill the following purposes &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>To ascertain the professional income earned by him correctly for a specific accounting period, and also to calculate the net professional income after deducting the related expenses from the professional income.</p></li>
<li><p>To correctly record all items of income and expenditure.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Following records should be maintained by a professional &minus;</p>
<h3>Cash Book</h3>
<p>All receipts and payments should be recorded in a cash book, and a memorandum book should be maintained to keep record of credit transactions. The credit transactions will be scored off at the time of actually cash receipt or at the time of payment made and should be entered in the cash book.</p>
<p>A cash book can be summarized under various heads on monthly, quarterly, half yearly, or annual basis as per the suitability and requirements.</p>
<h3>Stock Register</h3>
<p>Two separate stock registers should be maintained, one for resale items and other to keep record of the items of personal use. Resale items may be medicine, surgical items, the stationery items, electrical items, computers, and any other items or asset.</p>
<h3>Receipt and Expenditure Account</h3>
<p>A receipt and expenditure account is similar to a profit and loss account; therefore, it is prepared by the professionals to know the professional income and expenditure for a specific period. Outstanding incomes are ignored to prepare it, but outstanding expenses are included in it. Therefore, it is known as Receipt &amp; Expenditure account instead of Receipt &amp; Payment account. It means, incomes are recorded on a cash basis and expenditure on an accrual basis.</p>
<h2>Maintenance of Accounts by Doctors</h2>
<p>Doctors usually maintain a register that may also be known as diary or note book in which all the particulars of the patients including charges, fees, physical conditions of patient, etc. are recorded. After grouping, the extracted entries of diary are recorded in the cash book under different heads of income. Similarly, expenses are also recorded under various heads.</p>
<p>In case, where the number of doctors is two or more than two and they run their clinic in the partnership, income may be recorded in the cash book under various heads (Doctor Wise), similar to a petty cash book pattern. Similarly, the expenses relating to each doctor may be recorded under various heads of the expenses.</p>
<p>Thus, cash book, stock register, memorandum book, Receipt and expenditure account, and Balance sheet are prepared by the doctors.</p>

<h1>Financial Accounting - Insurance Claims</h1>
<p>Every business entity keeps sufficient stock as per the need and size of its respective business for smooth running of the business, but at the same time <b>risk of loss by fire</b> or by means is also there. To safeguard the businesses from any unforeseen circumstantial loss, most of the business entities buy insurance policy, which covers loss of stock (by fire) — is known as <b>stock policy</b>.</p>
<p>In consideration of the premium, insurance company takes the responsibility to compensate — if any loss occurs by fire or by other means, applicable under the insurance terms. It is in the best interest of the firm to take fire insurance policy because it covers wide range of losses (by fire) including Building damage, Furniture and Fixture loss, Plant &amp; Machinery destruction, etc.</p>
<p>Following are the important points to be considered for the estimation of stock &minus;</p>
<h3>Gross Profit on Sale</h3>
<p>Gross profit is calculated by deducting net sales from the cost of goods sold. To know the gross profit of the last year, “Trading” account of the last year should be referred.</p>
<h3>Memorandum Trading Account (for Current Year)</h3>
<p>In case of fire, Memorandum Trading account is required to find the value of estimated Stock. It is prepared with the help of Gross Profit ratio of the last year, Opening Stock, Purchase, Sale, and Direct Expenses.</p>
<h3>Value of Salvaged Stock</h3>
<p>Value of stock as calculated at step-2 will be reduced by the value of salvaged stock to arrive at the value of Insurance Claim.</p>
<h3>Other Important Points</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>In case, where stock is not valued at the cost, first it will be valued at the cost in the last year trading account and then in the memorandum account of the current year. For example, if it is given that stock of Rs. 80,750 is valued at 85% of the cost in the last year, then first it should be valued as $\small (\frac{80,750}{85} \times 100) = 95,000$ in the last year and then in the current year memorandum Trading account.</p></li>
<li><p>Cost of the sample given free of cost or withdrawal of stock by proprietor or partner  of the firm for personal use, it should be adjusted in the Trading Account of the last year as well as in the current year’s memorandum trading account.</p></li>
<li><p>In case, where gross profits of the last several years are given, average gross profit should be taken to determine the gross profit of the current year. However, in case where clear upward trend of the gross profit or downward trend of the gross profit is identified, <b>weighted average gross profit</b> or reasonable trend of upward or downward trend should be applied to determine the gross profit of the current year.</p></li>
<li><p>To find out the gross profit on normal sales, poor selling sale should be eliminated from the sale of the current year. Similarly, poor selling items should be eliminated from the opening and closing stock of the last years to prepare the trading account of the current year.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Average Clause</h3>
<p>An average clause is applied to find out the value of a claim where value of the stock on the date of fire is more than the value of insured stock. Average clause is applied by the insurance companies to discourage the under insurance of stock or any other assets.</p>
<p>Following illustration help you to understand it in a better way &minus;</p>
<p>Suppose, value of insurance policy is Rs. 1,500,000 and at the date of fire, value of  stock in hand is  Rs1,800,000, out of which approx. worth of 1,200,000 stock is destroyed, then  the value of  the claim admitted will be &minus;</p>
<p>$$\small Value\:of\:Claim = \frac{1,500,000}{1,800,000} \times 1,200,000 = 1,000,000$$</p>
<p>Value of stock of Rs. 1,200,000 will not be admissible to the insured, rather admissible claim will be Rs. 1,000,000.</p>
<h3>Illustration</h3>
<p>Fire occurred on the business premises of ‘Style India’ on 1<sup>st</sup> April, 2014 and most of the stock destroyed. Please ascertain the insurance claim from the following given particulars &minus;</p>

<h2>Important Terms and Expressions of Government Finance</h2>
<p>Following are the important terms and expressions used in Government accounting &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Demand for Grant</b> &minus; Without sanction from the Parliament, no expenditure can be incurred by any Government Authority. Public Authority can request for the grant of expenditure to the Government, this request is called “<b>Demand for Grant</b>”.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Supplementary Grant</b> &minus; Sometimes, grants are sanctioned before the end of the financial year, in case where annual budget might be inadequate. Supplementary demand can be made, if need arises to meet the expenditure. For example, amount granted for the Natural Disaster Relief fund, may be found inadequate due to extraordinary disaster by the flood; in such a condition, an additional grant may be asked by the concerned state or ministry.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Treasuries</b> &minus; Treasuries are the units of fiscal system in India. Every Indian States and Union Territory is divided into different districts’ headquarters and every district headquarters has one or more than one treasury. Treasuries are conducted by the State Bank of India as an agent of the Reserve Bank of India. Central Government and State Government keep their separate accounts and differences of Central and State Govt. are adjusted by the Reserve Bank of India.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Votable and Non-votable Items</b> &minus; To incur some expenditures, Parliamentary approval is not required; so, these expenditures may be charged from the Consolidated fund or the Public account, these items are known as <b>Non-votable</b> items. Some items of expenditure require sanction of the Parliament and cannot be incurred without its grant. Thus, demand for grant for that expenditure may be placed to the government, such items are called as <b>Votable</b> Items.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Appropriation Act</b> &minus; After the approval of the budget proposal in the Parliament or Legislature, an Appropriation Bill has to be introduced, when this Bill is passed, it becomes Appropriation Act. Now, money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India or the concerned State to meet the grants.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Vote on Account</b> &minus; In certain condition, when government has no time to place full budget in the Parliament, then it uses the special provision of ‘Vote on Account.’ Under this provision, government obtains the vote of the Parliament for the amount required to incur the expenditure of the items in demand. After sanction obtained in the Parliament, government obtains money from the Consolidated Fund of India.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Public Accounts Committee (PAC)</b> &minus; Public Account Committee is formed by the Parliament and each Legislature to scrutinize the Appropriation account and Audit the report thereon. All the reports on financial statements those are to be submitted to the President of Indian and in the Parliament are examined by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC). Examination by the PAC is similar to post-mortem of the reports. Members of the PAC are appointed from the Opposition Parties of the Parliament. Member of the ruling party cannot be part of this committee, as this committee is working as a watchdog to look after the affairs of ruling party.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Local Government Accounting</b> &minus; Accounting of the Local government is based on the concept of “fund accounting” and on the budget. Urban local government entities and rural local government entities are two types of local government entities. Accounting of the Local Government in India comprises budget, Receipt, and payment accounts.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Government Fund</h2>
<p>Government of India has following three types of Funds for marinating the records of all sorts of financial transactions &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Consolidated Funds of India</li>
<li>Contingency Funds of India</li>
<li>Public Account</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s discuss each of them succinctly &minus;</p>
<h3>Consolidated Funds of India</h3>
<p>As per the Clause 1 of the Article 266 of the Indian Constitution &minus;</p>
<p><i>“All revenues received by the Government by way of taxes like Income Tax, Central Excise, Customs and other receipts flowing to the Government in connection with the conduct of Government business i.e. Non-Tax Revenues are credited into the Consolidated Fund constituted. Similarly, all loans raised by the Government by issue of Public notifications, treasury bills (internal debt) and loans obtained from foreign governments and international institutions (external debt) are credited into this fund. All expenditure of the government is incurred from this fund and no amount can be withdrawn from the Fund without authorization from the Parliament.”</i></p>
<h3>Contingency Funds of India</h3>
<p>As per the Article 267 of the Indian Constitution &minus;</p>
<p><i>“The Contingency Fund of India records the transactions connected with Contingency Fund set by the Government of India. The corpus of this fund is Rs. 50 crores. Advances from the fund are made for the purposes of meeting unforeseen expenditure which are resumed to the Fund to the full extent as soon as Parliament authorizes additional expenditure. Thus, this fund acts more or less like an imprest account of Government of India and is held on behalf of President by the Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Finance, and Department of Economic Affairs.”</i></p>
<h3>Public Account</h3>
<p>The Public Account is constituted under Clause 2 of Article 267 of the Indian Constitution, which says &minus;</p>
<p><i>“The transactions relate to debt other than those included in the Consolidated Fund of India. The transactions under Debt, Deposits and Advances in this part are those in respect of which Government incurs a liability to repay the money received or has a claim to recover the amounts paid. The transactions relating to ‘Remittance’ and `Suspense’ shall embrace all adjusting heads. The initial debits or credits to these heads will be cleared eventually by corresponding receipts or payments. The receipts under Public Account do not constitute normal receipts of Government. Parliamentary authorization for payments from the Public Account is therefore not required.”</i></p>
<p>Similarly, all 29 states of India has the same structure as described above.</p>

<h3>Plant and Machinery</h3>
<p>Following are the two methods for charging value of Plant &amp; machinery to a contract account &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<td>
<p><b>a) Contract account will be debited with the full value of Plant &amp; Machinery</b> &minus;</p>

<p>On the basis of some percentage, these expenses may be distributed among several contracts. For example, charges of supervisor, engineer, administrative expenses etc.</p>
<h3>Sub Contract</h3>
<p>When a main or prime contractor assigns some specific work to another contractor as part of the main contract called as sub contract. Sub-contractors are paid by the main contractor. Sub-contractors normally do some specialized work, in which they are specialized. Charges paid to the sub-contractor will be shown in the debit side of the contract account.</p>
<h3>Extra Work Charges</h3>
<p>Any additional works in addition to the main contract, done by contractor as per the requirement of the Contractee, may be charged to same contract account. However, in case where volume of the extra work is not substantial; so, the amount received in lieu of that extra work should be added to the contract price.</p>
<p>In case where extra work is of substantial amount, a separate contract account should be prepared, as explained above.</p>
<h2>Recording of Value and Profit on Contracts</h2>
<h3>Certification of Work Done</h3>
<p>During the period of contract, Contractee has to pay sums of amount to contractor especially where a contractor is engaged in a big and long term contract.

<h3>Profit on Incomplete Contract</h3>
<p>Actual ascertainment of the cost is possible only after fully completion of the contract. Therefore, it is not possible to know the profit or loss on contract till it is completed.</p>
<p>However, following principles are adopted to estimate profit on uncompleted contracts &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>No profit is ascertained and transferred to profit and loss account where work is completed up to 25% of the total contract.</p></li>
<li><p>In case where contract is completed from 33.33% to approximately 75%, one-third amount of the notional profit may retain to suspense account as a provision for future loss and balance; two third is transferred to the profit and loss account. Sometime notional profit is further reduced in the ratio of the cash received and the work certified, the formula is &minus;</p>
<p>$$\small Notional\:Profit \times \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{Cash\:Received}{Work\:Certified}$$</p>
</li>
<li><p>In case where a contract is almost completed, proportion of an estimated profit is transferred to the profit &amp; loss account by one of the most popular formula as given below &minus;</p>
<p>$$\small Estimated\:Profit \times \frac{Work\:Certified}{Contract\:Price}$$</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; In case of any loss that should be transferred to Profit &amp; Loss account.</p>
<h3>Work in Progress</h3>
<p>Uncompleted contracts at the end of the financial year, which are known as work-inprogress will be accounted as &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Work-in-progress will be shown at the asset side of the Balance sheet on the account of expenses incurred the un-completed contracts.</p></li>
<li><p>Value of the work-in-progress will be inclusive of Profit.</p></li>
<li><p>Cash received from the Contractee will be deducted from the value of work-inprogress.</p></li>
<li><p>Contractee will be treated as a debtor only after completion of the contract.</p></li>
<li><p>Contractee will not be shown as creditor on account of cash received from him.</p></li>
<li><p>Cost of plant and material at the site will be shown separately as “Plant at site” and “Material at site” on the asset side of the Balance sheet.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Cost Plus Contract</h3>
<p>In some cases, it is not possible in advance to know the exact cost of contracts; therefore, <b>cost plus contract clause</b> need to be applied, in  which the value of contract is ascertain by adding  certain percentage of the profit in cost.</p>
<h3>Escalation Clause</h3>
<p>An Escalation clause is applied to cover up the changes in price due to change in prices of the raw material or change in utilization of the production capacity. Escalation clause safeguards both the contractor and the contractee against any unfavorable change in the cost or the price.</p>
<h3>Target Costing</h3>
<p>Under this method of a contract, contractee gives target of the production with target of the expenditure. Contractor cannot increase the cost of contract without increasing the production. It means, expenditure is fixed with the target of the production.</p>
<h1>Departmental Accounting</h1>
<p>Departmental stores have many types of stores under a single roof, for example one departmental store may have a cosmetic store, shoe store, stationery store, readymade departmental store, grocery stores, medicines, and many more.</p>
<p>It is essential to know the profit and loss account of each departmental store at the end of the accounting year. However, it can be done by maintaining the department wise Trading &amp; Profit and Loss account.</p>
<h2>Objectives of Departmental Accounting</h2>
<p>Following are the main objectives of the departmental accounting &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>To know the financial position of each and every department separately, it is helpful to make a comparison.</p></li>

<li><p>It is helpful in evaluating the result of each department.</p></li>
<li><p>It helps to know the profitability of each department.</p></li>
<li><p>Investors and outsiders may know the detailed information.</p></li>
<li><p>It is helpful in making comparison of each expenses (same department) of the different accounting years and different expenses (other departments) of the same accounting year.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Methods of Departmental Account</h2>
<p>There are two methods of keeping Departmental Accounts &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Separate Set of Books for each department</li>
<li>Accounting in Columnar Books form</li>
</ul>
<h3>Separate Set of Books for each Department</h3>
<p>Under this method of accounting, each department is treated as a separate unit and separate set of books are maintained for each unit. Financial results of each unit are combined at the end of accounting year to know the overall result of the store.</p>
<p>Due to high cost, this method of accounting is followed only by very big business houses or where to do so is compulsory as per the law. Insurance business is one of the best examples, where to follow this system is compulsory.</p>
<h3>Accounting in Columnar Books Form</h3>
<p>Small trading unit generally uses this system of accounting, where accounts of all departments are maintained together by central accounts department in the columnar books form. Under this method, sale, purchase, stock, expenses, etc. are maintained in a columnar form.</p>
<p>It is necessary that to prepare a departmental Trading and Profit and Loss Account, preparation of subsidiary books of accounts having different columns for the different department is required. Purchase Book, Purchase Return Book, Sale Book, Sales return books etc. are the examples of the subsidiary books.</p>

<h3>Allocation of Department Expenses</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Some expenses, which are specially incurred for a particular department may be charged directly to the respective department. For example, hiring charges of the transport for delivery of goods to customer may be charged to the selling and distribution department.</p></li>

<h1>Financial Accounting - Royalty Accounts</h1>
<p>Royalty is payable by a user to the owner of the property or something on which an owner has some special rights. A royalty agreement is prepared between the owner and the user of such property or rights. If payment is made to purchase the right or property that will be treated as capital expenditure instead of a Royalty.</p>
<p>Payment made by the lessee on account of a royalty is normal business expenditure and will be debited to the Royalty account. It is a nominal account and at the end of the accounting year, balance of Royalty account need to be transferred to the normal Trading and Profit &amp; Loss account. Royalty, based on the production or output, will strictly go to the Manufacturing or Production account. In case, where the Royalty is payable on sale basis, it will be part of the selling expenses.</p>
<h2>Types of Royalties</h2>
<p>There are following types of Royalties &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Copyright</b> &minus; Copyright provides a legal right to the author (of his book/s), the photographer (on his photographs), or any such kind of intellectual works.

<li><p><b>Mining Royalty</b> &minus; Lessee of a mine or quarry pays royalty to lessor of the mine or quarry, which is generally based on the output basis.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/financial_accounting/images/royalties_types.jpg" alt="Royalties Types" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Patent Royalty</b> &minus; Patent royalty is paid by the lessee to lessor on the basis of output or production of the respective goods.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Basis of Royalty</h2>
<p>In case of the patent, publisher of the book pays royalty to the author of the book on the basis of number of books sold. So, holder of patent gets royalty on the basis of output and the mine owner gets royalty on the basis of production.</p>
<h2>Important Terms</h2>
<p>Following are the important terms, which are used in Royalty agreements &minus;</p>
<h3>Royalty</h3>
<p>A periodic payment, which may be based on a sale or output is called Royalty. Royalty is payable by the lessee of a mine to the lessor, by publisher of the book to the author of the book, by the manufacturer to the patentee, etc.</p>
<h3>Landlord</h3>
<p>Landlords are the persons who have the legal rights on mine or quarry or patent right or copybook rights.</p>
<h3>Tenet</h3>
<p>An Author or publisher; lessee or patentor who takes out rights (usually commercial or personal rights) from the owner on lease against the consideration is called tenet..</p>
<h3>Minimum Rent</h3>
<p>According to the lease agreement, minimum rent, fixed rent, or dead rent is a type of guarantee made by the lessee to the lessor, in case of shortage of output or production or sale. It means, lessor will receive a minimum fix rent irrespective of the reason/s of the shortage of production.</p>
<p>Payment of royalty will be minimum rent or actual royalty, whichever is higher for example &minus;</p>

</table>
<h3>Shortworkings</h3>
<p><b>Difference</b> of minimum rent and actual royalty is known as shortworkings where payment of Royalty is payable on the basis of minimum rent due to shortage in the production or sale. For example, if calculated royalty is Rs. 900,000/- as per sale of books based on the above example, but royalty payable is Rs. 1000,000 as per minimum rent, shortworking will be Rs. 100,000 (Rs. 1,000,000 – Rs. 9,00,000).</p>
<h3>Ground Rent</h3>
<p>The rent, paid to the landlord for the use of land or surface on the yearly or half yearly basis is known as <b>Ground Rent</b> or <b>Surface Rent</b>.</p>
<h3>Right of Recouping</h3>
<p>It may contain in the royalty agreement that excess of minimum rent paid over the actual royalty (i.e. shortworkings), may be recoverable in the subsequent years. So, when the royalty is in excess of the minimum rent is called the right of recoupment (of shortworkings).</p>
<p>Right of recoupment will be decided for the fixed period or for the floating period. When the right of recoupment is fixed for the certain starting years from the date of royalty agreement, it is said to be fixed or restricted. On the other hand, when the lessee is eligible to recoup the shortworkings in next 2 or 3 years from the year of its commencement, it is said to be floating.</p>
<p>Shortworking will be shown on the asset side of Balance sheet up to allowable year of recouping after that it will be transferred to profit &amp; loss account (after expiry of allowable period).</p>
<h3>Lease Premium</h3>
<p>An <b>Extra payment</b> in addition to royalty, if any, paid by lessee to lessor is called Lease premium and will be treated as capital expenditure and it will be written off on yearly basis through profit and loss account as per the suitable method.</p>
<h3>TDS (Tax Deducted at sourceSource)</h3>
<p>If there is an applicability of TDS (Tax deducted at source) as per Income Tax Act, lessee will make the payment to lessor after deducting TDS as per applicable rate and lessee is liable to deposit it to the credit of Central Government. Amount of royalty will be gross amount of royalty (inclusive of TDS), that will be charged to profit and loss account.</p>
<p>For example, if royalty amount is 1,000,000/-&amp; rate of TDS is 10%, then lessee will pay Rs. 900,000/- to lessor. Amount of royalty charge to profit and loss account will be Rs. 1,000,000/- and balance amount of Rs. 100,000/- will be deposited in the credit of central Government account.</p>
<h3>Stoppage of Work</h3>
<p>Sometime, there may be stoppage of work due to conditions beyond control like strike, flood, etc. in this case, minimum rent is required to be revised as provided in the agreement.</p>

<li>By a fixed amount in the year of stoppage.</li>
</ul>
