<h1>Study of Indian History</h1>
<h2>Important Features of History</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The important aspects of the study (of History) are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>To know - how did agriculture or other means of existence begin.</p></li>
<li><p>When did our primitives begin the use of metal and how did they develop spinning, weaving, metalworking, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>How did the political and administrative systems evolve</p></li>
<li><p>How did the development of literature, urban life, science, and architecture evolve, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>History does not mean only the description of the dates and events related to the kings or dynasties, but rather it also means to study various aspects that shaped the overall personality of the society and the people.</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore, the study of history is the study of the entire human past, which goes back to millions of years.</p></li>
<li><p>Throughout the period (starting from Ancient, Medieval, and Modern), every society has developed over a long period of time; however, they differ in terms of courses they followed and the processes they underwent.</p></li>
<li><p>The primitives experienced stone-age, hunter-gatherers and they all practiced agriculture. Over a period of time, the primitives began to use metal at one time or the other. In spite of so much similar activities, still they differ in their cultural, social, political, and religious identity.</p></li>
<li><p>The study of history helps in understanding the people, societies, and nations and finally, the whole humanity gets a sense of identity and belonging.</p></li>
<li><p>It may be a very superficial view to ask &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Why should study history?</p></li>
<li><p>Does it contribute anything economically to our society?</p></li>
<li><p>Does it solve the problem of poverty and unemployment?</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Of course, History does not answer these question, but History helps us in knowing the past people, their cultures, their religions, and their social systems, and suggests us how to make future better.</p></li>
<li><p>History, further, makes us learn lessons from the past for the present and future. It reminds us not to repeat the mistakes, which led to various manmade calamities and disasters like wars (in the past).</p></li>
<li><p>History guides us why and how to ignore the bad things that created problems in society and follow the things, which promote harmony, peace, and prosperity.</p></li>
<li><p>Ashoka (the king of ancient Patliputra), in his Rock Edict XII, insisted on the following measures and practices to maintain harmony, peace, and prosperity in the society &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Promotion of the common ground or root of all religion.</p></li>
<li><p>Cultivation of the sense of unity of all religions by the practice of <i>vachaguti</i> or restraint of criticism of other religions and sects.</p></li>
<li><p>The coming together (<i>samavaya</i>) of exponents of different religions in religious assemblies</p></li>
<li><p>Learning the texts of other religions so as to become <i>bahusruta</i> or proficient in the scriptures of different religions.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Purpose of Studying History</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The study of past does not mean that one lives in the past, but one learns to live with the past.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/ancient_indian_history/images/voltaire.jpg" class="examsimg" alt="Voltaire" />

<h1>Writing of Ancient Indian History</h1>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>During the 4<sup>th</sup> century B. C., <b>Kautilya</b> in his book <i><b>‘Arthashastra’</b></i> advises the king to dedicate some time for hearing the narrations of history.</p></li>
<li><p>History was conferred holiness equal to pious <i>Veda, Atharvanaveda, Brahmanas,</i> and <i>Upanishads</i>. The <i>Itihas-Purana</i> is one of the branches of knowledge of history.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Puranas</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>There are 18 main <i>Puranas</i> and 18 subsidiary <i>Puranas</i>.</p></li>

<li><p><i>Manvantantar</i> (recurring of the Time)</p></li>
<li><p><i>Vamsa</i> (genealogical list of the kings and sages)</p></li>
<li><p><i>Vamsanucharita</i> (life stories of some selected characters)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The reign of <b>Parikshit</b> (the grandson of <b>Arjuna</b>) was considered as a benchmark for the reference of the royal genealogies given in the <i>Puranas</i>.</p></li>
<li><p>In <i>Puranas</i>, all the earlier dynasties and kings prior to reign of Parikshit, have been mentioned in past tense. While the latter kings and dynasties have been narrated in a future tense.</p></li>
<li><p>This may be due to the fact that the <i>Puranas</i> were completed during the reign of Parikshit. As mentioned in the <i>Puranas</i>, the coronation of Parikshit marks the beginning of <i><b>Kali</b></i> Age.</p></li>
<li><p>In the context of the <i>Puranas</i>, it is observed that in ancient India, <i>ltihas</i> (History) was looked upon as a means to illuminate the present and future in the light of the past.</p></li>
<li><p>The purpose of history was to understand and inculcate a sense of duty and sacrifice by individuals to their families, by the families to their clans, by the clans to their villages, by the villages to <i><b>Janapada</b></i> and <i><b>Rashtra</b></i>, and ultimately to the whole humanity.</p></li>
<li><p>During the ancient time, history was treated as a powerful vehicle of the awakening of cultural and social consciousness. Therefore, the narrations of <i>Puranas</i> were a compulsory part of the annual ritual in every village and town (especially) during the rainy season and at the time of festivals. F. E. Pargitar and H. C. Raychaudhury have attempted to write history on the basis of genealogies of various dynasties mentioned in the <i>Puranas</i>.</p></li>

<li>F. W. Hegel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The works of a few intellectuals have been described below &minus;</p>
<h3>Max Muller</h3>
<img src="/ancient_indian_history/images/max_muller.jpg" class="examsimg" alt="Max Muller" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Friedrich Max Muller is considered as one of the most respected Indologists of the nineteenth century. He was a German, but lived in England. On the financial support of the British East India Company, he undertook massive jobs of translation and interpretation of the Indian religious texts in English.</p></li>
<li><p>He attained the best achievement of getting translated a huge mass of Sanskrit texts into English, but his approach and intention were never free from the prejudice.</p></li>
<li><p>Muller was inspired by his religious belief and political requirements that affected his entire approach of unbiased writing and interpretation of Indian history.</p></li>
<li><p>The guiding principle under which William Jones, Max Muller, and Vincent Smith wrote Indian history, was to settle all history within the period up to 4,000 B.C.</p></li>
<li><p>In 1868, Max Muller wrote to the Duke of Argyll <i>“The ancient religion of India is doomed, and if Christianity does not step in, whose fault will it be?"</i></p></li>
<li><p>The majority of works done on Indian history during the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries were guided by the preconditions imposed by the belief in the Genesis and to reject all the writing that were projecting India's past in terms of great civilization and Indian philosophy and thoughts indicating great antiquity for the origins of universe and human beings.</p></li>
<li><p>The major factor that is responsible for the distortion of the ancient Indian history was the British imperial interests in India. They were worried about the fact that popularity of the Indian text among British civilians might develop an inferiority complex in them.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>James Mill</h3>
<img src="/ancient_indian_history/images/james_mill.jpg" class="examsimg" alt="James Mill" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Between 1806 and 1818, James Mill wrote six volumes on the history of India without ever visiting India or knowing any Indian language. He divided Indian history into three periods i.e.</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Hindu Period,</p></li>
<li><p>Muslim Period, and</p></li>
<li><p>British Period – (all he did without any logic and justification).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Mill presented an extremely demeaning picture of Hindu periods. He condemned every institution, idea, and action of the Hindu period and held Hindus responsible for all the ills of the country.</p></li>
<li><p>Mill’s book was introduced as a text book in the Harley bury school in England, which was established to educate the young Englishmen coming to India as administrators and civil servants.</p></li>
<li><p>James Mill, his son John Stuart Mill, and his disciple Thomas Macauley played a very important role in shaping the imperialist policy in India and the future of Indian education in the core of which was the distorted history of ancient India.</p></li>
<li><p>V.A. Smith, an officer serving the British Government in India, prepared the text book called <i>‘Early History of India in 1904.’</i> He emphasized the role of foreigners in ancient India. Alexander's invasion accounted for almost one-third of his book.</p></li>
<li><p>Smith's racial superiority is clear with his sentence i.e. <i>"The triumphant progress of Alexander from the Himalayas to the sea demonstrated the inherent weakness of the greatest Asiatic armies when confronted with European skill and discipline".</i></p></li>
<li><p>Smith had given the impression that Alexander had conquered the whole of India from the Himalayas to seas while the fact is that, he only touched the northwestern borders of India.</p></li>
<li><p>Smith had presented India as a land of dictatorship, which did not experience political unity until the establishment of the British rule.</p></li>
<li><p>The whole approach of Imperial historians was to give such interpretations of Indian history to denigrate Indian character and achievements, and justify the colonial rule.</p></li>
<li><p>Vincent Arthur Smith (1843-1920) prepared the first systematic history of ancient India that published in 1904.</p></li>
<li><p>On the basis of the Bible story of Creation Bishop Usher had calculated that the whole universe was created at 9.00 a.m. on 23<sup>rd</sup> October 4004 B.C. and the Great Flood took place in 2,349 B.C.</p></li>
<li><p>In the light of Indian concept, the age of the Earth is several hundred million years that the <i>Bible</i> stories of creation appears to be wrong and threatened the very foundation of the faith.</p></li>
<li><p>With the object to promote the Sanskrit learning among the English, Boden Professorships of Sanskrit at Oxford University was endowed by Colonel Boden. This was precisely for enabling his countrymen to proceed in the conversion of the natives of India to the Christian religion.</p></li>
<li><p>Prizes were offered to the literary works for refutation of the Hindu religious systems and undermining Indian tradition.</p></li>

<h1>Historiography: Nationalist Approach</h1>

<li><p>R.G. Bhandarkar,</p></li>
<li><p>R. C. Majumdar,</p></li>
<li><p>V. K. Rajwade etc. </p></li>

</li>
<li><p>Bhandarkar and Rajwade worked on the history of Maharashtra region and reconstructed the social, political, and economic history of the area.</p></li>
<li><p>D. R. Bhandarkar, H. C. Raychaudhary, R. C. Majumdar, P. V. Kane, A. S. Altekar, K. P. Jayaswal, K. A. Nilakant Sastri, T. V. Mahalingam, H. C. Ray, and R. K. Mookerji were some other Indian historians who attempted to describe Indian History (according to Indian point of view).</p></li>
<li><p>D. R. Bhandarkar (1875-1950), in his books, on Ashoka and on Ancient Indian Polity helped in clearing many myths created by the imperialist historians.</p></li>
<li><p>K. P. Jayaswal (1881- 1937), in his book, Hindu Polity published in 1924, effectively knocked down the myth that Indians had no political ideas and institutions.</p></li>
<li><p>Jayaswal revealed (on the basis of his study of literary and epigraphical sources) that India was not a despotic country as propagated by the imperialist historians, but rather India had the tradition of republics right from Rig Vedic times.</p></li>
<li><p>K. P. Jayaswal’s book Hindu Polity is considered as one of the most important books ever written on ancient Indian history.</p></li>
<li><p>H. C. Raychaudhury (1892-1957) reconstructed the history of ancient India from the time of Mahabharata War to the time of Gupta Empire and practically cleared the clouds created by V. A. Smith. The title of his book is <i>‘Political History of Ancient India’</i>.</p></li>
<li><p>R. C. Majumdar wrote a number of books covering the time period from ancient India to the freedom struggle.</p></li>
<li><p>Majumdar is considered as a leader among Indian historians. The most outstanding achievement under his editorship is the publication of <i>‘History and Culture of the Indian People in eleven volumes.’</i></p></li>
<li><p>K. A. Nilakant Sastri (1892-1975) in his books <i>‘A History of Ancient India’</i> and <i>‘A History of South India’</i> contributed immensely towards the understanding of South Indian history.</p></li>
<li><p>R. K. Mookerji (1886-1964) in his books including Hindu Civilization, Chandragupta Maurya, Ashoka, and Fundamental Unity of India, expressed the cultural, economic, and political history of India in simple terms and made it accessible even to a lay reader.</p></li>
<li><p>P. V. Kane’s (a great Sanskritist, 1880-1972) work i.e. the <i>‘History of Dharmasastra’</i> in five volumes is considered as an encyclopedia of social, religious, and political laws and customs.</p></li>

<h1>Marxist School of History</h1>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The Marxist school of historiography was significant in the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. They believe in universal laws and stages of history.</p></li>

<li><p>Feudalism</p></li>
<li><p>Capitalism</p></li>
<li><p>Communism</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The stages of history proposed by Marx and Engels were based on their understanding of European history. They clearly acknowledged their intellectual debt to F. W. Hegel and Lewis Henry Morgan.</p></li>
<li><p><b>G. W. F. Hegel</b> (1770-1831) was a great western philosopher. He made no attempt to learn Sanskrit or any other Indian language. His writings on Indian history and philosophy were based mainly on the writings of William Jones, James Mill, and other British writers whose approach to ancient Indian history has already been discussed above; so, the results were really disastrous.</p></li>
<li><p>Hegel reluctantly accepted that India had a philosophical system and its history had great antiquity and he explicitly considered Indian system to be inferior to that of the Greeks and the Romans.</p></li>
<li><p>Marx knowledge about India was not really free from racial considerations. He took his lead from Hegel.</p></li>
<li><p>Marx was a great supporter of British rule in India and dismissed India as a backward and uncivilized nation with no history.</p></li>
<li><p>The Hegelian and Marxian approach to Indian history by and large remained dormant for a long time. It was largely non-existent during the British rule in India.</p></li>
<li><p>The Marxist school of historiography became one of the most influential and dominant schools after the independence of India.</p></li>
<li><p>Marx held that all that is good in Indian civilization is the contribution of conquerors”. Therefore, according to this school, the <i><b>Kushana</b></i> period is the golden period of Indian history and not the <i><b>Satavahanas</b></i> or <i><b>Guptas</b></i>.</p></li>
<li><p>According to Marxist School of History, the period from the Gupta's to the conquest of Muslims in the 12<sup>th</sup> century A.D. has been termed as the "Period of Feudalism" i.e. "Dark Age" during which everything degenerated.</p></li>
<li><p>D. D. Kosambi was the first among the pioneers of the Marxist school of thought.</p></li>
<li><p>D. R. Chanana, R. S. Sharma, Romila Thapar, Irfan Habib, Bipan Chandra, and Satish Chandra are some of the leading Marxist historians of India.</p></li>

<li><p>Tools and remains found in the Kashmir and Narmada valleys show that the human activities started in the subcontinent as early as two million years ago.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Inscriptions</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The inscriptions are the most important and reliable sources of Indian history.</p></li>
<li><p>Inscriptions are the contemporary documents those are free from later interpolations as it is impossible to add something to it at a later period. Therefore, it comes in the original form as it was composed in and engraved.</p></li>
<li><p>The manuscripts were written on soft materials like birch bark, palm leaf, paper etc. They became fragile in a course of time and were frequently required to be copied and at the time of copying, some irrelevant additions were made and some errors tend to creep in. Therefore, they are not considered as a reliable source of information about history.</p></li>
<li><p>The script of the inscriptions also helps the historian in many ways.</p></li>
<li><p>The <i><b>Harappan</b></i> seals depict the earliest system of writings, however, they could not be decoded yet.</p></li>
<li><p>The Ashokan inscriptions are claimed to be the earliest one of the systems of writing. Ashoka’s inscriptions are found written in four scripts.</p></li>
<li><p><i><b>Kharoshthi</b></i> script was used in Pakistan region, which is written from right to left and is evolved on the <i>Varnamala</i> (alphabet) system of the Indian languages.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/ancient_indian_history/images/kharoshthi_script.jpg" alt="Kharoshthi script" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p><b><i>Brahmi</i></b> script was used for the rest of the empire from Kalsi in the north in Uttaranchal up to Mysore in the south.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Palaeography</b> is the study of development of the scripts.</p></li>
<li><p>The epigraphic studies started in the late 18<sup>th</sup> century.</p></li>
<li><p><i>Brahmi</i> script was adopted by the rulers after Ashoka and continued for succeeding centuries.</p></li>
<li><p>The <i>Brahmi</i> script kept modifying century after century, which led to the development of most of the scripts of India, including <i>Tamil, Telugu, Kannada,</i> and <i>Malayalam</i> in the south and <i>Nagari, Gujarati, Bangla,</i> etc. in the north.</p></li>
<li><p>The modifications in the letters of the script have made it possible to ascertain the time period in which the inscription was written.</p></li>
<li><p>In 1837, <b>James Prinsep</b> completed the chart of <i>Ashokan</i> alphabets.</p></li>
<li><p>The inscriptions of Ashoka had been recorded in different years of his reign and are known as edicts because they are in the form of the king's order or desire</p></li>
<li><p>The edicts of Ashoka prove that he (Ashoka) was a benevolent king concerned with the welfare of not only his subjects, but also of the whole humanity.</p></li>
<li><p>Inscriptions of the Indo-Greeks, <i>‘Saka-kshatrapas’</i> and <i>‘Kushanas’</i> adopt Indian names after two or three generations. These inscriptions illustrate that they were also engaged in social and religious welfare activities like any other Indian kings.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Junagarh Rock</b> inscription of Rudradaman was written in the mid of 2<sup>nd</sup> century A.D. It was an early example of an inscription written in Sanskrit; however, Sanskrit became prominent since the Gupta period.</p></li>
<li><p>Pillar inscription of Allahabad describes the achievements of Samudragupta.</p></li>
<li><p>The epigraphs of the Gupta period started trends of giving the genealogy of kings with the account of their conquests and achievements. This became a trend of the subsequent dynasties to give a list of their predecessors and mention mythology of their origins.</p></li>
<li><p>The <i><b>Aihole</b></i> inscription of the Chalukya king Pulkeshin-II describes a dynastic genealogy and achievements.</p></li>
<li><p>The Gwalior inscription of Bhoja also gives a full account of his predecessors and their achievements.</p></li>

<h2>Numismatics</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Numismatics is considered as the second most important source for reconstructing the history of India after inscriptions.</p></li>

<li><p>Coins found in systematic excavations are less in number, but are very valuable because their chronology and cultural context can be fixed precisely.</p></li>
<li><p>Earliest coins are known as the <i>punch-marked</i> coins. They are made of either silver or copper. In addition to this, some gold punch-marked coins were also found, but they are very rare and their authenticity is doubtful.</p></li>
<li><p>The Indo-Greek coins were also made up of silver and copper and rarely in gold.</p></li>
<li><p>The <i>Kushanas</i> issued their coins mostly in gold and copper, rarely in silver.</p></li>

<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The <i>Guptas</i> issued their coins mostly in gold and silver but the gold coins are numerous.</p></li>
<li><p>The punch-marked coins that bear (only) symbols on them are the earliest coins of India. Each symbol is punched separately, which sometimes overlap the other.</p></li>
<li><p>Punch-marked coins have been found throughout the country, starting from Taxila to Magadha to Mysore or even further south. They do not bear any inscription or legend on them.</p></li>
<li><p>The <b>Indo-Greek coins</b> depict beautiful artistic features on them. The portrait or bust of the king on the observe side appear to be real portraits and on the reverse, some deity is depicted.</p></li>
<li><p>The information about <i>Saka-Parthians</i> kings also came through their coins.</p></li>
<li><p>The <i>Kushanas</i> issued mostly gold coins and numerous copper coins, which are found in most parts of north India up to Bihar.</p></li>
<li><p>The <i>Vima Kadphises</i> coins bear the picture of Lord Siva standing beside a bull illustrate the Indian influence from the very beginning.</p></li>
<li><p>The king calls himself <i>Mahesvara</i> i.e. devotee of Siva in the depiction on coins. Kanishka, Huvishka, and Vasudeva etc. all have this depiction on their coins.</p></li>
<li><p>Kushana coins depicted many Indian gods and goddesses along with many Persian and Greek deities.</p></li>
<li><p>The Guptas had succeeded Kushanas in the tradition of imprinting coins. They completely had been <i>Indianized</i> their coinage.</p></li>

<h2>Geography of India in Indian Literature</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The Geography of India that played a significant role in shaping ancient Indian history has been described much expressively in ancient Indian literature.</p></li>

<li><p>The <i>Sapta-Sindhu</i>, referring to the region of the seven rivers of the <i>Saraswati</i>.</p></li>
<li><p><i>Zend-Avesta</i> (which is the sacred book of <i>Parasis</i>), uses the term <i>Sapta-Sindhu</i> for India.</p></li>
<li><p>The Greeks uses the term <i>‘Indos’</i> for the river Sindhu subsequently borrowed the term from the Persians.</p></li>
<li><p>Herodotus, the famous Greek historians, used the term <i>'Indos'</i> to the <i>kshatrapy</i> of the Persian Empire. Gradually, Greek and Roman writers begin to use this term for the whole country.</p></li>
<li><p>Chinese used the term <i>Tien-Chu</i> or <i>Chuantu</i> for India during the first century A.D.</p></li>
<li><p>Hiuen-Tsang promotes the term <i>Yin-Tu</i> to refer India.</p></li>
<li><p>Following are the distorted forms of ‘Sindhu’ &minus;</p>

<li><p><i>Indus</i> in Latin, and</p></li>
<li><p><i>Tien-chu</i> in Chinese.</p></li>

</li>
<li><p>I-Tsing, a Chinese scholar says &minus; "<i>Hindu is the name used only by the northern tribes and the people of India themselves do not know it</i>".</p></li>
<li><p>I-Tsing mentioned other terms such as <i>Arya-desa</i> and <i>Brahmarashtra</i> for India.</p></li>
<li><p>In the sixth century B.C., for the first time, Panini mentioned the term <i><b>‘Bharata’</b></i> for a region, which was only one out of 22 <i>Janapadas</i> (specified from <i>Kamboja</i> to <i>Magadha</i> in Northern India).</p></li>
<li><p>Buddhist literature speaks of seven <i>Bharata</i> regions (<i>Sapta-Bharatas</i>) corresponding to the ancient <i>Sapta-Sindhu</i>.</p></li>
<li><p>During 150 B.C. (at the time of <i>Patanjali</i>), a region was named as <i><b>Aryavarta</b></i>.

<h3>Influences of Geography on Indian History</h3>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The geographical features of a region influence people’s activity and his <b>interactions with nature</b> and other groups in different ways.</p></li>

<li><p>Pilgrimage and places of worship are distributed throughout the country.</p></li>
<li><p>Cultural bonds gave a <b>sense of unity</b> and <b>nationality</b> to all Indians</p></li>
<li><p>There are several regions, which have a distinct sense of regional spirit and cultural traits.</p></li>
<li><p>Larger kingdoms and empires rose from these units and weakened, in due course, giving way to another unit to come up.</p></li>
<li><p>The <i>Chakravarti</i> was a concept of conquest that aspires the kings to grow their kingdom and to rule the whole country.</p></li>
<li><p>The early conquerors from the north-west, such as <i>Indo-Greeks, Saka-Pallavas, Kushanas,</i> etc., established the kingdoms and empires in the western part of India, but never shown their eagerness to adopt Indian ideas of polity and willingness to assimilate themselves in the main stream of the Indian society.</p></li>
<li><p>The old kingdoms of <i>Kosala, Magadha, Gauda, Vanga, Avanti, Lat,</i> and <i>Saurashtra</i> in the north, and <i>Kalinga, Andhra, Maharashtra, Kamataka, Chera, Chola,</i> and <i>Pandya</i> in the southern part had ruled for long period human history and seem to possess eternal lives.</p></li>
<li><p>People living along coast line were experts in maritime activities. They developed trade relations with other countries as well.</p></li>
<li><p><i>Cholas</i> dynasty, in the south, had attempted to conquer lands beyond the sea.</p></li>
<li><p>Although Indians had spread in many parts of the known world, but in the South East Asia, they developed a lasting cultural influence in the countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia, etc. It was due to individual efforts by traders and princes and not by any State.</p></li>
<li><p>The Indian traders not only gave their religion and philosophy to the people of other countries (mentioned in the above point), but also assimilated themselves in their religion and philosophy as well.</p></li>

<li><p>Western India and the northern Deccan; and</p></li>
<li><p>Southern Deccan.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Agriculture and animal domestication were the main economic activity of early Neolithic cultures.</p></li>
<li><p>The evidence of the agricultural based economy of Neolithic culture comes from the <i>Quetta</i> valley and in the Valleys of <i>Loralai</i> and <i>Zob</i> rivers in the north-western part of the Indo-Pakistan region.</p></li>
<li><p>The site of <i>Mehrgarh</i> has been extensively examined and the result shows that the habitation here began in (around) 7,000 B.C. There is also an evidence of the use of ceramic during this period.</p></li>
<li><p>Around 6,000 B.C., earthen pots and pans were used; initially handmade and later wheel-made.</p></li>
<li><p>Initially, in the pre-ceramic period, the houses were in irregular scatter of square or rectangular shape and were made up of mud bricks.</p></li>
<li><p>The first village was formed by separating the house by waste dumps and passage ways between them.</p></li>
<li><p>The houses were generally divided into four or more internal compartments to be used some as storage.</p></li>
<li><p>The subsistence of early inhabitants was primarily depended on hunting and food gathering and additionally supplemented by some agriculture and animal husbandry.</p></li>
<li><p>The domestic cereals included wheat and barley and the domesticated animals were sheep, goat, pig, and cattle.</p></li>
<li><p>Beginning of the 6<sup>th</sup> millennium B.C. marked as the use of pottery by the human beings; first handmade and then wheel-made.</p></li>
<li><p>The people of this period, used to wear beads made up of lapis lazuli, carnelian, banded agate, and white marine shell. Beads were found with burial remains.</p></li>
<li><p>The people were largely engaged in long-distance trade as suggested by the occurrence of shell bangles and pendants made up of a mother of pearl.</p></li>
<li><p>During 7,000, the Neolithic settlement at <i>Mehrgarh</i> marked the early food-producing subsistence economy and beginning of trade and crafts in the Indus valley.</p></li>
<li><p>The communities in the Indus valley during the next 2,500 years developed new technologies to produce pottery and figurines of terracotta; elaborate ornaments of stone and metal; tools and utensils; and architectural style.</p></li>
<li><p>Large numbers of Neolithic sites have been found in the <i>Ganga</i> valley, Assam, and the north-east region.</p></li>

<li><p>The early Neolithic settlers in <i>Burzahom</i> lived in pit dwellings, rather than building houses on the ground.</p></li>
<li><p>The settlement at <i>Chirand</i> in Bihar is of the later period (relatively) to Indus valley.</p></li>
<li><p>Small polished Neolithic stone axes have been found from <i>Cachar</i> Hills, <i>Garo</i> Hills, and Naga Hills in north-east regions of India.</p></li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The centers of Chalcolithic cultures flourished in semi-arid regions of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and Maharashtra.</p></li>
<li><p>The settlements of <i>Kayatha</i> culture were mostly located on the <i>Chambal</i> River and its tributaries. They were only a few in number and relatively small in size and the biggest may not be over two hectares.</p></li>
<li><p>The settlements of <i>Ahar</i> Culture were larger in comparison to <i>Kayatha</i> culture.</p></li>
<li><p>Excavations revealed that they used stone, mud bricks, and mud for the construction of houses and other structures. <i>Balathal</i> settlement was a fortified settlement.</p></li>
<li><p>The settlements of <i>Malwa</i> culture are mostly located on the Narmada and its tributaries. The three best known settlements of <i>Malwa</i> culture are at <i>Navdatoli, Eran,</i> and <i>Nagada</i>.</p></li>
<li><p><i>Navdatoli</i> was one of the largest Chalcolithic settlements in the country. It was spread in almost 10 hectares. Some of these sites were fortified. <i>Eran</i> had a fortification wall with a moat. <i>Nagada</i> had a bastion of mud-bricks.</p></li>
<li><p>Very few not more than half dozen settlements of <i>Prabhas</i> culture are known.</p></li>
<li><p>The settlements of <i>Rangpur</i> culture are located mostly on <i>Ghelo</i> and <i>Kalubhar</i> rivers in Gujarat.</p></li>

<li><p>The Chalcolithic cultures grown during the 3,000 to 2,000 B.C.</p></li>
<li><p>Excavation shows that large number of settlements like <i>Kayatha, Prabhas, Ahar, Balathal, Prakash,</i> and <i>Nevasa</i> were deserted due to decline in rainfall, which made it hard for the agricultural communities to sustain. They were reoccupied after four to six centuries.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Technology</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The Chalcolithic people were farmers. They had made considerable progress in ceramic as well as metal technology. They used painted pottery, which was well made and well fired in a kiln. It was fired at a temperature between 500 and 700&deg; C.</p></li>

<li><p>It has been found during the course of excavation in the region that the sites yielding this pottery have suffered from extensive floods. And, it is suggested by many scholars that the entire upper Gangetic plains was for some length of time submerged under water.</p></li>
<li><p>The people of OCP culture used copper tools and cultivated rice, barley, gram, and <i>khaseri</i>.</p></li>
<li><p>The OCP cultures have many shapes identical with the <i>Harappan</i> ware.</p></li>
<li><p>In the excavations at <i>Saipai</i> (in the District of Etah), Copper Hoard objects were found along with the OCP deposit.</p></li>
<li><p>In the region of Ganga-Yamuna doab, almost all the Copper Hoards have been found along with deposits of the OCP, which reflects that the Copper Hoards are associated with OCP people in doab. But their cultural association in Bihar, Bengal, and Orissa is not clear.</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the copper hoard types, mainly <i>Celts</i>, have been found associated with Chalcolithic people also.</p></li>

<h1>Ancient Indian History - Harappan Civilization</h1>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Till 1920, the relics of the civilization were found only in the Indus valley region; therefore, it was known as the Indus civilization.</p></li>
<li><p>In 1920-21, the <i>Harappan</i> civilization was discovered in the excavations by D. R. Salini (at <i>Harappa</i>) and by R. D. Banerjee (at <i>Mohenjo Daro</i>).</p></li>
<li><p>The remains of the civilization were first noticed at <i>Harappa</i>, therefore it is also known as the <i>Harappan</i> civilization.</p></li>

<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The 1,400 settlements of this civilization discovered so far are distributed over a very wide geographical area covering almost 1,600 km (east to west) and 1,400 km (north to south).</p></li>
<li><p><i>Harappan</i> civilization extent starts from &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p><i>Sutkagendor</i> (Baluchistan) in the west to <i>Alamgirpur</i> (Meerut, Uttar Pradesh) in the east and</p></li>
<li><p><i>Manda</i> (Akhnoor District, Jammu and Kashmir) in the north to <i>Daimabad</i> (Ahmadnagar District, Maharashtra) in the south.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>About 1,400 settlements of the <i>Harappan</i> culture are known from different parts of India. About 925 settlements sites are now in India and 475 are in Pakistan.</p></li>
<li><p>The total geographical stretch of <i>Harappan</i> civilization is about <b>1,250,000 sq</b>. km which is more than <b>20 times of the area of Egyptian</b> and more than <b>12 times</b> of the combined area of Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilizations.</p></li>
<li><p>Mostly, the <i>Harappan</i> settlements were located on river banks of which &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Only 40 settlements were located on the Indus and its tributaries;</p></li>
<li><p>As many as 1,100 (80%) settlements were located on the vast plain between the Indus and the Ganga, comprising mainly the <i>Saraswati</i> river system (which no more exist);</p></li>
<li><p>About 250 settlements were found in India beyond the <i>Saraswati</i> River system; a number of them were located in Gujarat, and a few in Maharashtra.</p></li>
<li><p>The distribution pattern of settlements shows that the focus of <i>Harappan</i> civilization was not the Indus, but the <i>Saraswati</i> River and its tributaries, which flowed between the Indus and the Ganga. Therefore, few researchers prefer to call it as <i>Saraswati</i> civilization or <i>Indus-Saraswati</i> civilization</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The settlements belonging to this civilization can be classified as</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Small villages (which were up to 10 hectares),</p></li>
<li><p>Larger towns and small cities (10 to 50 hectares).</p></li>
<li><p>Large cities settlements such as &minus;</p>

<li><p><i>Dholavira</i> (&plus;100 hectares).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Large cities were surrounded by vast agricultural lands, rivers, and forest that were inhabited by scattered farming and pastoral communities and bands of hunters and food-gatherers.</p></li>
<li><p>Excavations at the sites of <i>Mohenjo Daro, Harappa, Kalibangan, Lothal, Surkotada, Dholavira,</i> etc. have given us a fair idea about the various aspects such as town planning, economy, technology, religion, etc. of this civilization.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Harappan Town Planning</h1>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The orientation of streets and buildings, according to the cardinal directions east-west, and north-south was the distinguishing factor of the <i>Indus-Saraswati</i> cities.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/ancient_indian_history/images/town_planning.jpg" alt="Town Planning" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p><i>Harappan</i> city sites, including <i>Mohenjo Daro, Harappa, Kalibangan,</i> and <i>Surkotada</i> were having large gateways at various entry points of the city. These gateways are seen even in the inner fortification areas also.</p></li>
<li><p>At <i>Dholavira</i>, a fallen signboard was found close to the main gateway. It is a large inscription having ten symbols each measuring approximately 37 cm high and 25 to 27 cm wide proclaimed some name or title.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Materials Used in Buildings</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Most settlements were situated in the alluvial plains where the most common building materials were mud-bricks and kiln-fired-bricks, wood and reeds.</p></li>
<li><p>In the foothills and on the Islands of Kutch and in Saurashtra, dressed stone replaced bricks (due to an abundance of stone).</p></li>
<li><p>The sizes of bricks have been found identical proportions 1:2:4, that the width is double the thickness and the length four times, the thickness.</p></li>
<li><p>Doors and windows were made up of wood and mats.</p></li>
<li><p>Floors of houses were generally hard-packed earth that was often plastered.</p></li>
<li><p>Drains and bathing areas were made with baked bricks or stone.</p></li>
<li><p>Roofs were probably made of wooden beams covered with reeds and packed clay.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Types of Buildings</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Excavations have uncovered many types of houses and public buildings at both large and small settlements.</p></li>
<li><p>The architecture may be grouped into three categories with some variations as &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Private houses,</p></li>
<li><p>Large houses surrounded by smaller units, and</p></li>
<li><p>Large public structures.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Doorways and windows rarely opened out into the main street, but faced side lanes.</p></li>
<li><p>The view into the house was blocked by a wall or a room around the front door. This was done to protect the activities in the central courtyard from the view of passers-by.</p></li>
<li><p>The doors were made with wooden frames and a brick socket set in the threshold served as door pivot.</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the doors seem to have been painted and possibly carved with simple ornamentation</p></li>
<li><p>The windows were small at first and second stories.</p></li>
<li><p>The adjacent houses were separated by a narrow space of "no man's land".</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Public Buildings</h3>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Some large and distinct structures have been found in several cities designed especially for the public purpose.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Great Bath of Mohenjo Daro</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The Great Bath of <i>Mohenjo Daro</i> is the most remarkable feature of any <i>Harappan</i> site.</p></li>
<li><p>The Great Bath was a brick structure, which measured 12 m by 7 m and is nearly 3 m deep from the surrounding pavement.</p></li>
<li><p>Water was evidently supplied by 3 large well placed in an adjacent room.</p></li>
<li><p>Surrounding the bath, there were porticos and sets of rooms, while a stairway led to an upper storey.</p></li>
<li><p>The bath was linked with some sort of ritual bathing, which was very common in Indian life right from the ancient times to till date.</p></li>
<li><p>Immediately to the west of the Great Bath (at <i>Mohenjo Daro</i>) was a group of 27 blocks of brickwork crisscrossed by narrow lanes. This structure measures 50 m. east-west and 27 m. north-south. These structures have been identified as granaries, which were used for storing grains. Similar structures have been also found at <i>Harappa, Kalibangan,</i> and <i>Lothal</i>.</p></li>
<li><p>The dockyard found at Lothal was another important structure. It was a large structure measuring 223 m. in length, 35 m. in width and 8 m. in depth, provided with an inlet channel (12.30 m. wide) in the eastern wall and a spillway.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/ancient_indian_history/images/great_bath_of_mohenjo_daro.jpg" alt="Great Bath of Mohenjo Daro" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The inlet channel was connected to a river. By its side, it was 240 m. long and 21.6 m wide wharf. This was a dockyard where ships and boats used to come for loading and unloading of trading goods.</p></li>
<li><p><i>Lothal</i> was a major trading center of the <i>Harappan</i> civilization.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Streets and Drains</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The most outstanding features of the <i>Harappan</i> civilization were the streets and side lanes equipped with drains system.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/ancient_indian_history/images/drainage_system.jpg" alt="Drainage System" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The streets cut each other on the right angles and the width of these streets was in a set ratio.</p></li>
<li><p>No encroachment on the streets was to be seen.</p></li>
<li><p>Even smaller towns and villages had impressive drainage systems. This indicates that people had a great civic sense of sanitation and care for health and hygiene.</p></li>
<li><p>Burnt bricks were used to make drains. Small drains connected with bathing platforms and latrines of private houses were joined with the medium sized drains in the side streets then these drains ran into larger sewers in the main streets which were covered with bricks or dressed stone blocks.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Harappan Crafts and Industries</h1>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The <i>Harappan</i> civilization is referred to as a Bronze Age civilization.</p></li>
<li><p>Customarily, unalloyed copper was used for manufacturing artifacts and rarely tin was mixed with copper to make bronze.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Harappan Tools</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Tools and weapons were simple in form. They comprised of flat -axes, chisels, arrowhead, spearheads, knives, saws, razors, and fish-hooks.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/ancient_indian_history/images/harappan_tools.jpg" alt="Harappan Tools" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>People also made copper and bronze vessels. They made small plates and weights of lead, and gold and silver jewelry of considerable sophistication.</p></li>
<li><p>The <i>Harappans</i> continued to use knives of <i>chert</i> blades. Further, a great skill and expertise have been seen in precious and semi-precious stone beads and weights.</p></li>
<li><p>Long barrel shaped cornelian beads (up to 10 cm. long) are the finest examples of craftsmanship.</p></li>
<li><p>Steatite was used for making a variety of objects like seals, beads, bracelets, buttons, vessels, etc. but its use in making faience (a form of glass) is particularly noteworthy.</p></li>
<li><p>The gold objects found in the form of beads, pendants, amulets, brooches, and other small ornaments in the <i>Harappan</i> civilization. The <i>Harappan</i> gold is of light color indicating high silver content.</p></li>
<li><p>Mature <i>Harappan</i> pottery represents a blend of the ceramic tradition of the pre-<i>Harappan</i> culture of both west of the Indus region as well as of the <i>Saraswati</i> area.</p></li>
<li><p>The pottery technology was quite advanced. Most of the pots were wheel-made.</p></li>
<li><p>Big storage jars were also produced. Pots were beautifully painted in black on the bright red surface with geometric designs, plants, animals, and a few paintings seem to depict scenes from stories.</p></li>
<li><p>More than 2,500 seals have been found. These are made of steatite. They mostly depict a single animal-unicorn bull, elephant, rhinoceros etc. but some also depict trees, semi-human, and human figurines; in some cases, participating in a ceremony.</p></li>
<li><p>Shell working was another flourishing industry. Artisans, settlements close to the sea manufactured shell ornaments like pendants, rings, bracelets, inlays, beads etc., besides objects as bowls, ladles, and gamesmen.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Trade and Commerce</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Intensive agricultural production and large-scale trade played significant roles in flourishing of the <i>Harappan</i> civilization.</p></li>
<li><p>The elegant social structure and the standard of living must have been achieved by a highly developed system of communication and a strong economy.</p></li>
<li><p>The trade must have been internal in the beginning i.e. between one zone and another.</p></li>
<li><p>Agricultural produce, industrial raw materials (including copper ores, stone, semi-precious shells, etc.) were traded on a large scale.</p></li>
<li><p>Besides the raw material, they used to trade &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Finished products of metals (pots and pans, weapon, etc.);</p></li>
<li><p>Precious and semi-precious stones (beads, pendants, amulets, etc.); and</p></li>
<li><p>Ornaments of gold and silver were also traded to various areas.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>They procured &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Copper from <i>Khetri</i> mines of Rajasthan;</p></li>
<li><p>Chert blades from <i>Rohri</i> hills of Sindh;</p></li>
<li><p>Carnelian beads from Gujarat and Sindh;</p></li>
<li><p>Lead from south India;</p></li>
<li><p>Lapis-lazuli from Kashmir and Afghanistan;</p></li>
<li><p>Turquoise and jade from central Asia or Iran;</p></li>
<li><p>Amethyst from Maharashtra; and</p></li>
<li><p>Agate, chalcedony, and carnelian from <i>Saurashtra</i>.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The occurrence of mature <i>Harappan</i> seals and other artefacts in contemporary Mesopotamian civilization, and some of the Mesopotamian and Egyptian objects in <i>Harappan</i> civilization, and the evidence of Mesopotamian documents established that the <i>Harappans</i> had the trading relationship with each other.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Weights and Measures</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The trade requires a regulation of exchange and of weights and measures.</p></li>
<li><p><i>Harappan</i> weights and measures were cubical and spherical in shape and were made up of <i>chert, jasper, and agate</i>.</p></li>
<li><p>The system of weights proceeded in a series i.e.</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>first doubling, from 1, 2, 4, 8, to 64, then going to 160; then</p></li>
<li><p>Decimal multiples of sixteen, 320, 640, 1600, 6400 (1600 &times; 4), 8000 (1600 &times; 5) and 128,000 (i.e. 16000 &times; 8).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The tradition of 16 or its multiples continued in India till 1950s.</p></li>
<li><p>Sixteen <i>chhatank</i> made a <i>ser</i> (equivalent to one kilo) and 16 <i>annas</i> made one rupee.</p></li>
<li><p>The measure of length was based upon a foot of 37.6 cm. and a cubit of 51.8 to 53.6 cm.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Transport and Travel</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Pictures of ships and boats are found on some seals and drawings on pottery from <i>Harappa</i> and <i>Mohenjo Daro</i>.</p></li>
<li><p>Ship or a boat, with a stick-impressed socket for the mast, has been found from Lothal.</p></li>
<li><p>The boats depicted on seals and pottery resembles with the boats used in Sindh and Punjab areas (even today).</p></li>
<li><p>For land transport, bullock-carts and pack animals like bull, camel, ass etc. were used.</p></li>
<li><p>The terracotta models of bullock-cart found on roads from various sites indicate that carts used in those days were of the same size and shape used in the present day.</p></li>

<h2>Arts</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>A large variety of objects such as seals, stone statues, terracotta, etc. is superb examples of the art activities.</p></li>
<li><p>A <i>Yogi</i> from <i>Mohenjo Daro</i> and two small figurines from <i>Harappa</i> are the most outstanding pieces of art.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/ancient_indian_history/images/dancing_girl.jpg" class="examsimg" alt="Dancing girl" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>A dancing girl statue of about 11.5 cm. in height made up of bronzes was found from <i>Mohenjo Daro</i>.</p></li>
<li><p><i>Daimabad</i> bronze animals’ workmanship, most likely belong to <i>Harappan</i> period.</p></li>
<li><p>The red sandstone torso found at Harappa is made up of <b>detachable limbs and head.</b></p></li>
<li><p>The grey stone torso perhaps illustrates a dancing figure. Both these are so <b>realistic</b> that none would believe that they belong to the <i>Harappan</i> period.</p></li>
<li><p><i>Harappan</i> people produced a large number of terracotta figurines, which were handmade. The figurines include humans, animals, birds, and monkey.</p></li>
<li><p>Following are the Specimen of Arts from the <i>Harappan</i> Civilization &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Bronze statue (Dancing Girl);</p></li>
<li><p>Terracotta Bulls;</p></li>
<li><p>Terracotta Female Figurine;</p></li>
<li><p>Head of a Yogi; and</p></li>
<li><p>Painted Jar dogs, sheep, and cattle.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The most artistic depictions are the figures of humped bull. Figurines of both humped and humpless bulls are found in excavations</p></li>
<li><p>A painting was found only on pottery. Unfortunately, no wall paintings, even if there were any, have survived.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Script</h2>
<img src="/ancient_indian_history/images/indus_valley_script.jpg" class="examsimg" alt="Indus valley script" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The language of <i>Harappan</i> is still unknown. But some scholars connect it to the Dravidian languages and others to Indo-Aryan and Sanskrit.</p></li>
<li><p>There are nearly 400 specimens of <i>Harappan</i> signs on seals and other materials such as copper tablets, axes, and pottery. Most of the inscriptions on seals are small, a group of few letters.</p></li>
<li><p>The Harappa script has 400 to 500 signs and it is generally agreed that it is not an alphabetic form of writing.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Agriculture</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Agriculture was generally practiced along the river banks most of which were flooded during the summer and monsoons. The flood deposited every year fresh alluvial silt, which is highly productive and for which no major furrowing and certainly no manures and irrigation were required.</p></li>
<li><p>The cultivated field excavated at <i>Kalibangan</i> shows crisscross furrow marks indicating that two crops were grown simultaneously. This method is followed even today in the Rajasthan, Haryana, and western Uttar Pradesh.</p></li>
<li><p>The granaries found at <i>Harappan</i> cities suggest that cereals were produced in such a large quantities. They also kept enough reserve to face any future emergency.</p></li>
<li><p>The principal cereals were wheat and barley. Rice was also known and was a favored grain. Remains of rice have been found from Gujarat and Haryana areas.</p></li>
<li><p>Six varieties of millets including <i>ragi, kodon, sanwa,</i> and <i>jowar</i> were cultivated, along with peas and beans.</p></li>
<li><p>Fragments of cotton cloth found at <i>Mohenjo Daro</i> and other sites show that cotton was also grown.</p></li>
<li><p>Cotton has been found at <i>Mehrgarh</i> at least 2,000 years before the mature phase of the Civilization. This is the oldest evidence of cotton in the world.</p></li>
<li><p>Other major crops include dates, varieties of legumes, sesame, and mustard.</p></li>
<li><p>Wooden plough with a copper or wooden ploughshare was used for tilling fields.</p></li>
<li><p>Terracotta models of the plough have been found at <i>Mohenjo Daro</i> and <i>Banawali</i>.</p></li>
<li><p>Harvesting of crops would have been done with copper sickles as well as stone blades hafted in wood.</p></li>
<li><p>Animals like sheep, goat, humped bull, buffalo, elephant, etc. have been depicted on the seals. This shows that the range of animals domesticated by the <i>Harappan</i> people was quite large.</p></li>
<li><p>Skeletal remains of several animals like sheep, goat, bull, buffalo, elephant, camel, pig, dog, and cat etc. have been found in excavations.</p></li>
<li><p>Wild animals were hunted for the food. Bones of animals like spotted deer, sambhar deer, hog deer, wild pig, etc. found in the excavation prove it. Besides, several types of birds as well as fishes, were also hunted for food.</p></li>
<li><p>Bones of horses have been reported from <i>Lothal, Surkotada, Kalibangan,</i> and several other sites.</p></li>
<li><p>Terracotta figurines of the horse have been found at <i>Nausharo</i> and <i>Lothal</i>. But this animal is not depicted on seals.</p></li>

<h1>Ancient Indian History - Harappan Religion</h1>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li>There are generally two aspects of Harappan religion &minus;
<ul class="list examslist">
<li>Conceptual or philosophical and</li>
<li>Practical or ritualistic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<img src="/ancient_indian_history/images/mother_goddess.jpg" class="examsimg" alt="Mother Goddess" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li>The available evidence indicates that the religion of the Indus people comprised of &minus;
<ul class="list examslist">
<li>Worship of the Mother Goddess;</li>
<li>Worship of a male deity, probably of Lord Siva;</li>
<li>Worship of animals, nature, semi human, or fabulous;</li>
<li>Worship of trees in their natural state or of their indwelling spirits;</li>
<li>Worship of inanimate stones or other objects, of <i>linga</i> and <i>yoni</i> symbol;</li>
<li>Chrematheism as illustrated in the worship of the sacred "incense-burners";</li>
<li>Faith in amulets and charms indicative of demonophobia; and</li>
<li>Practice of yoga.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>These characteristics suggest that the religion was mainly of an indigenous growth and "the lineal progenitor of Hinduism,” which is characterized by most of the features.</p></li>
<li><p>A large number of female figurines of terracotta have been found, which are the representations of the Great Mother Goddess.</p></li>
<li><p>A striking rectangle sealing found at <i>Harappa</i> represents the Earth or Mother Goddess with a plant growing from her womb.</p></li>
<li><p>A male deity, which depiction Siva as <i>Pasupati</i> (i.e. the prototype of the historic Siva), is portrayed on a seal with three faces, seated on a low throne in the typical posture of a Yogi, with two animals on each side - elephant and tiger on right and rhinoceros and buffalo on left, and two deer standing under the throne.</p></li>
<li><p>A terracotta piece having <i>linga</i> and <i>yoni</i> in one piece found from <i>Kalibangan</i>. People of Kalibangan region were worshiped the symbolic representation of <i>Siva</i> and <i>Sakti</i> respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>A remarkable seal, found at <i>Mohenjo Daro</i>, standing between two branches of a <i>pipal</i> tree, represents the deity.</p></li>
<li><p>A large number of 'fire-altars' have been found from the sites located in Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Haryana. From <i>Kalibangan, Lothal,</i> and <i>Banawali</i> a number of 'fire-altars' have been found.</p></li>
<li><p><i>Swastika</i>, a sacred symbol with Hindus, Buddhists, and Jaina has been depicted on seals, painting, and graffiti.</p></li>
<li><p>A large number of terracotta figurines depict the individuals in various yogic postures (<i>asanas</i>) indicating thereby that the <i>Harappans</i> practiced yoga.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Social Stratification</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The <i>Harappan</i> society appears to have been divided into three sections, viz.</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>An elite class associated with the Citadel;</p></li>
<li><p>A well-to-do middle class; and</p></li>
<li><p>A relatively weaker section, occupying the lower town, which was generally fortified.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The Craftsmen and laborers normally were resided outside the fortified area.</p></li>
<li><p>It is, however, difficult to say whether these divisions were based purely on the economic factors or had a socio-religious basis.</p></li>
<li><p>At <i>Kalibangan</i>, it appears that the priests resided in the upper part of the citadel and performed rituals on fire altars in the lower part of it.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Political Setup</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>It is also difficult to ascertain that what kind of political setup was prevailed at the time of the <i>Harappan</i> civilization.</p></li>
<li><p>The entire area of Indus Empire was administered from one capital, with a few regional administrative centers or provincial capitals.</p></li>
<li><p>There were several independent states or kingdoms, each with cities like <i>Mohenjo Daro</i> in Sindh, <i>Harappa</i> in Punjab, <i>Kalibangan</i> in Rajasthan, and <i>Lothal</i> in Gujarat as their capitals.</p></li>
<li><p>During 1,000 B.C., the area was divided into sixteen <i>Mahajanapadas</i> each independent with its own capital.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Disposal of the Dead</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Scattered burials, as well as discreet cemeteries, have been found at many major sites.</p></li>
<li><p>The skeletal remains are few in comparison to the size of settlements and the population that may have lived on them.</p></li>
<li><p>The general practice was that skeletons were placed in an extended position with the head towards the north. Earthen pots containing food grains, etc. were placed in the grave and, in some cases, the body was buried with ornaments.</p></li>
<li><p>Cremation was also practiced, which has been proved by many cinerary urns or other receptacles containing calcined human bones and ashes together with vessel offerings for the use of a dead person in the next life.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Harappan Chronology</h1>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Marshall suggested that <i>Harappan</i> civilization flourished between 3,250 and 2,750 B.C.</p></li>

<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p><b>John Marshall</b> (Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India from 1902 to 1928) declares that <i>Harappan</i> civilization declined due to environmental degradation. The cutting of forests for agricultural land and timber for fuel and over-exploitation of resources, etc. resulted in the land to become barren and in the silting of rivers.</p></li>
<li><p>The environmental degradation, flood, drought, and famine must have become a recurring feature, which finally led to its decline.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Wheeler</b> opined that it was destroyed by the <i>Barabarian</i> Aryans who came to India in about 1,500 B.C.</p></li>
<li><p>The archaeological or biological evidence proved that Wheeler's thesis of Aryan was the destroyer of the <i>Harappan</i> civilization was a myth.</p></li>
<li><p>The <i>Harappan</i> civilization was spread over a large area. There may be many causes of its decline as &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>In the River <i>Saraswati</i> region, most likely, it declined mainly due to shifting of river channels.</p></li>
<li><p>Along the River Indus, most likely, it declined largely due to recurring floods.</p></li>
<li><p>Rainfall declined in general, which affected the agriculture, the main economic resource.</p></li>
<li><p>With the decline in economic conditions all other institutions like trade and commerce, administrative and political structures, Civic amenities, etc. also declined over a period of time.</p></li>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Vedas</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Veda means "<b>knowledge</b>". The Vedas formed the earliest segment of Vedic literature.</p></li>

<li><p>Compositions of the hymns are credited to Hindu <i>Rishis</i> (monks) of divine origin.</p></li>
<li><p>The Vedas are called <i><b>‘apaurusheya’</b></i> (not created by man) and <b><i>‘nitya’</i></b> (existing in all eternity) while the <i>Rishis</i> are known as inspired seers who received the <i>mantras</i> from the Supreme deity.</p></li>

<h2>Age of RigVeda</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The origin of the earth goes back to about 4,600 million years and the origin of humans themselves goes back to about 4.2 million years (ago).</p></li>
<li><p><b>Max Muller</b> gives arbitrarily the date of composition of Rig Veda to be around 1,200 to 1,000 B.C.</p></li>
<li><p><b>W. D. Whitney</b> negated and criticized Muller for using totally arbitrary, unscientific, and un-academic method in assigning the dates.</p></li>
<li><p>On the analogy of the language of <i>Avesta</i>, some scholars opined that the date of Rig Veda may be <b>1,000 B.C</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the Vedic gods namely <i>Indra, Varuna, Mitra,</i> and the two <i>Nasatyas</i> were mentioned in <i>Boghaz-Koi</i> (Asia Minor) inscription of 1,400 B.C., which proves that Rig Veda must have come into existence much before the date described by some of the foreigner scholars.</p></li>
<li><p>The <i>Boghaz-Koi</i> inscription records a treaty between the <i>Hittite</i> and the <i>Mitanni</i> Kings and the gods (mentioned in the above point) were cited as witnesses to this treaty.

<li><p>Bal Gangadhar Tilak, on astronomical grounds, dated Rig Veda to 6,000 B.C.</p></li>
<li><p>Harmon Jacobi held that Vedic civilization flourished between 4,500 B.C. and 2,500 B.C. and the <i>Samhitas</i> were composed in the latter half of the period.</p></li>
<li><p>Famous Sanskritist, Winternitz felt that the Rig Veda was probably composed in the third millennium B.C.</p></li>
<li><p>R. K. Mukerjee suggested that "on a modest computation, we should come to 2,500 B.C. as the time of Rig Veda".</p></li>
<li><p>G. C. Pande also favors a date of 3,000 B.C. or even earlier.</p></li>

<li><p><i>Indra</i> and <i>Varuna</i> (the supreme cosmic and moral ruler) stand out in that order, pre-eminent above the rest.</p></li>
<li><p><i>Agni</i> and <i>Soma</i> were also popular deities. <i>Agni</i> was valued as the messenger between the earth and the heaven. <i>Agni</i> is the only God who is regarded as present among all the categories of Gods.</p></li>
<li><p>Gods are described as born yet they are immortal. In appearance, they are humans, though sometimes they are conceived as animals, e.g. <i>Dyaus</i> as a bull and <i>Sun</i> as a swift horse.</p></li>

<h1>Ancient Indian History - The Aryan Invasion</h1>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Similarities between Sanskrit and European languages (especially with Latin and Greek) was first noticed by a merchant <b>Filippo Sassetti</b>, who lived in Goa between 1583 and 1588 A.D.</p></li>
<li><p>Sir William Jones and many other scholars who were in the service of East India Company elaborated the language similarities (between European and Indian languages).</p></li>
<li><p>On the basis of the similarities, some scholars postulated that the ancestors of Indians and Europeans, must at one time, had lived in the same region and spoken the same language.</p></li>
<li><p>The scholars called this Indo-European language and their common homeland as the Indo-European homeland. This created a great divergence of opinion about the problem of identifying the original homeland of the Aryans, which was still a matter of debate.</p></li>
<li><p>A number of homelands (of Aryans) have been propounded, such as Steppe of central Asia, southern Russia, southern Europe, Germany, Chinese Turkistan, or even Mediterranean area like Palestine and Israel. Almost everywhere, the Vedic language and its literature were found (except India).</p></li>
<li><p>The <b>Rig Veda</b> is the <b>oldest surviving</b> records of the Aryans. It does not give any evidence (even a suspicion) of any migration of Aryans from any other area.</p></li>
<li><p>Max Muller assigned period between 1,200 or 1,000 B.C. for this event. Max Muller as a true Christian believed in Bible and according to Bible, the world was created on 23<sup>rd</sup> October 4,004 B.C. and thus Max Muller had the challenge to accommodate the entire human history within the 6,000 years.</p></li>
<li><p>The Aryans were originally inhabitants of India and did not come from outside as there is no archaeological or biological evidence, which could establish the arrival of any new people from outside between 5,000 B.C. and 800 B.C.</p></li>
<li><p>The skeletal remains found from various <i>Harappan</i> sites resemble the skeletons of the modern population of the same geographical area.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Harappan Civilization and Rigveda</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>A careful consideration of the evidence of the Rig Veda will lead to the conclusion that references it contains about people and their civilization may be taken to refer to the <i>Harappan</i> civilization.</p></li>
<li><p>The Discovery of <i>Boghaz-Koi</i> inscription (of 14<sup>th</sup> century B.C.) mentioned Rig Vedic deities that the Rig Veda existed earlier and the culture migrated from India to Asia Minor in that early age.</p></li>
<li><p>The time period of the Rig Veda in its final form should be placed not later than about 3,000 B.C.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Similarities between Rig Vedic and Harappan Civilizations</h3>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The geographical distribution of the <i>Harappan</i> sites can be seen in the light of Rig Vedic geography as well.</p></li>
<li><p>The geographical features, mentioned in the Rig Veda, confirms the extension of Vedic Civilization from Afghanistan in the north to Gujarat in the south, <i>Ganga</i> in the east to <i>Kubha (Kabul)</i> in the west.</p></li>
<li><p>The Rig Vedic culture was flourished in the area around the <i>Saraswati</i> river and its tributaries; more than 80% of the <i>Harappan</i> settlements are found around the <i>Saraswati</i> valley thus it was the main area of <i>Harappan</i> civilization.</p></li>
<li><p>The animals known to the Indus people are also known to the Rig Veda, including sheep, dog, buffalo, bull, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The animals hunted by the Rig Vedic people were antelopes, boars, buffalos (gaur), lions, and elephants most of them were also familiar to the Indus people.</p></li>

<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>A Terracotta Figurine of Horse found from Lothal. The horse was an important animal in the Vedic period. Horse bones and terracotta figurines have been found at some <i>Harappan</i> sites as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the religious practices of the <i>Harappan</i> people like worship of <i>Pipal</i> trees, bull, <i>Siva-lingas</i> are still followed by the modern Hindus.</p></li>
<li><p>Some terracotta figurines of women found at Nausharo still have vermillion in their hair-parting. <b>Vermillion in the Hair Parting</b> is the most precious and sacred symbol of married Hindu women even today.</p></li>
<li><p>A terracotta tablet from <i>Harappa</i> depicts the scene of <i><b>Mahisa sacrifice</b></i>, reminding us of <i>Mahisasuramardini</i>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <i>Harappan</i> people were aware of using ornaments like earrings, necklaces, bracelets, anklets, garlands, and jewels.</p></li>
<li><p>Rig Veda mentions the use of gold and <i>ayas</i> (copper). <i>Ayas</i> was used in making of vessels.</p></li>
<li><p>The above-discussed similarities found between the Rig Vedic and <i>Harappan</i> civilization have led to the conclusion that the <b><i>Harappan</i> civilization is the same as the Vedic civilization</b> and <b>the Aryans did not come to India from outside.</b></p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Ancient Indian History - Later Vedic Age</h1>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The different branches of Vedic literature had grown out of one another.</p></li>
<li><p>The four Vedas were followed by the <i>Brahmanas</i>, the <i>Aranyakas</i>, and the <i>Upanishads</i>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <i>Brahmanas</i> explain in detail various Vedic sacrificial ceremonies and their origins. It is the earliest of the Aryan's prose literature.</p></li>
<li><p>The <i>Aranyakas</i> contains the philosophical and mystical content. They are called so because their contents required that they should be studied in the isolation of the forest (<i>aranya</i>). They are the closing portions of the <i>Brahmanas</i>.</p></li>
<li><p>In the last phase of the Vedic literature, Upanishads were deduced form the tradition of the <i>Aranyakas</i>.</p></li>
<li><p>The Rig Veda deals with <i>Karmakanda</i> (ritualistic) and philosophical aspects.</p></li>
<li><p>The <i>Brahmanas</i> contains the ritualistic aspect.</p></li>
<li><p>The Upanishads contains the philosophic aspect.</p></li>
<li><p><i>Chhandogya</i> and <i>Brihadaranyaka</i> are the two oldest and most important of forms of the Upanishads.</p></li>

<h2>Geography and New Political States</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">

<li><p>Jana known in Rig Vedic period like <i>Bharatas, Purus, Tritsus,</i> and <i>Turvasas</i> were slowly merging with other <i>Janas</i> and disappeared from the scene. People of <i>Anus, Druhyus, Turvasas,</i> the <i>Krivis</i>, were also vanished.</p></li>
<li><p>The states, namely <i>Kasi, Kosala, Videha, Magadha,</i> and <i>Anga</i> developed in the eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. However, the areas of south India are not clearly mentioned.</p></li>
<li><p>The struggle for supremacy among different states was of frequent occurrence. The ideal of universal empire appeared.</p></li>
<li><p><i>Satapatha Brahmana</i> mentioned the expansion of people towards the east.

<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p><b><i>Atman</i></b> i.e. (self) is the Ultimate, Enduring, and Unitary Reality in the individual.</p></li>
<li><p><i><b>Brahma</b></i> is the Ultimate Reality in and beyond the objective world. Brahma has created the entire world: it originates from Brahma, it exists in Brahma; and it merges into Brahma. The Brahma is real, infinite, and blissful Consciousness.</p></li>
<li><p>The pure <i>Atman</i> and <i>Brahma</i> are one. An individual would be right in saying <i>"I am Brahma."</i></p></li>
<li><p>The one <i>Brahma</i> appears as many because of <b><i>Maya</i></b>, the wonderful power of Brahma.</p></li>
<li><p>The union of Atman with Brahma is called <i>‘Moksha.’</i> It is a state that liberates one from the chain of birth and death and is the highest goal of human life.</p></li>
<li><p>All unhappiness and sufferings of man are due to ignorance of the fact that man is the Atman, which is the same as the Brahma.</p></li>
<li><p>To realize the Atman, one has to give up all desires for worldly and finite objects, purify one's intellect, and live a righteous life.</p></li>

<li><p>Two hundred years after the death of Mahavira (during the reign of Chandragupta Maurya), a terrible famine broke out in Magadha. Bhadrabahu was the chief of the Jaina community at that time.</p></li>
<li><p>Bhadrabahu went to Karnataka with his followers and Sthulabhadra remained in Magadha as the in-charge of Jainism.</p></li>
<li><p>Bhadrabahu convoked a council at Patliputra, in which the Jaina canon was arranged.</p></li>
<li><p>Later in the 5<sup>th</sup> century A.D., the Jaina canon was further rearranged when the Jainas returned from south India. From where Jainism divided into two sects.</p></li>

<h1>Evolution of Buddhism</h1>

<li><p>Gautama was married to Yasodhara at an early age. Gautama was shocked at the sight of an old man, a diseased person, a dead body. Thereafter, he was attracted by the saintly appearance of an ascetic. One night he renounced the worldly life and left his home, wife, and son.</p></li>
<li><p>After leaving home, Gautama studied for some time in the philosophical schools of two renowned teachers. Thereafter, six years of profound meditation led to the discovery of truths. Gautama became the <i><b>‘Buddha’</b></i> i.e. the enlightened one.</p></li>

<h1>Alexander’s Campaign in India</h1>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>During the Alexander’s period, the western borderland of India was occupied by two <i>Maha-Janpadas</i>, namely Kamboja and Gandhara, which included the region of modern Punjab, Sindh, and Afghanistan.</p></li>
<li><p>In 522-486 B.C. (during the reign of Darius), <i>Achaemenians</i> extended their empire to the northwestern part of India and they had subjugated a number of principalities living to the south of the Hindukush Mountains.</p></li>

<li><p>The evidences prove that the Indian soldiers were the part of the <i>Achaemenian</i> army that conquered Greece in the time of Xerxes (486-465 B.C.) and also fought against Alexander at Gaugamela in 330 B.C.</p></li>
<li><p>The defeat of Darius III (the Achaemenian king) by Alexander became a turning point. Alexander dismantled the Persian Empire and captured most of the western Asia including Iraq and Iran.</p></li>

<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>In 326 B.C., after the conquest of the Persian Empire, Alexander marched to India through the Khyber Pass.</p></li>
<li><p>It is surprising that no Indian source mentions anything about Alexander or his campaign. The history of Alexander's campaign in India has been reconstructed on the basis of accounts available in Greek and Roman sources. It is also surprising to note that Greek sources are completely silent about Kautilya.</p></li>
<li><p>The Greek sources, however, mention about Sandrocottas or Androcottas who has been identified as Chandragupta Maurya and fixing 326 B.C. as the date of Chandragupta's accession to the throne.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Alexander Expeditions in India</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>In 326 B.C. when Alexander reached on the Indian soil, the king of Takshasila near Rawalpindi in Punjab offered help to him. But many of the Republican Chiefs and kings in Afghanistan, Punjab, and Sindh had poised a brave resistance and refused to submit to the Alexander without a fight.</p></li>
<li><p>Alexander divided his army into two parts after crossing Hindukush and Alexander himself, conquers the north-western part of India.</p></li>
<li><p>The Greeks had faced a strong resistance from tribal <i>Hasti</i> chief having capital <i>Pushkalavati</i>.</p></li>
<li><p>The army of Assakenoi king was led by the queen, which was the example of an enthusiasm for the defense of the country by the people of these regions that even women and the mercenaries took part in fighting and preferred a glorious death.</p></li>
<li><p>In spite of a hard resistance for many days (by the Assakenoi soldiers), Alexander captured the city <i>Massaga</i> (the capital of Assakenoi).</p></li>
<li><p>After the victory of Assakenoi, Alexander had himself resolved a special agreement by which he granted the lives of the army of 7,000 mercenaries. But deceitfully, they had been slaughtered mercilessly in the night by Alexander and his soldiers. This massacre of Assakenoi has been condemned even by the Greek writers.</p></li>
<li><p>Alexander, after defeating Assakenoi, joined his other division of army and constructed a bridge on the Indus River nearby Attock.</p></li>
<li><p>After crossing the Indus, Alexander proceeded towards Taxila, but the king Ambhi admited the sovereignty of the Alexander.</p></li>
<li><p>Paurava (Greeks call Porus), the ruler of a kingdom between the Jhelum and the Chenab was the most powerful among the north-western Indian provinces. Alexander made intense preparations to defeat him.</p></li>
<li><p>Porus fought bravely and with nine wounds on his body, was led a captive before Alexander.</p></li>
<li><p>When Porus was brought as captive before Alexander, he (Alexander) asked him how he would like to be treated. Porus replied proudly, "Like a King".</p></li>
<li><p>Alexander made a coalition with the brave king Porus by restoring his kingdom and adding to it the territories of 15 republican states along with 5,000 cities and villages.</p></li>
<li><p>Alexander had to fight hard with the Kathaioi (Kathas) on the bank of river Beas. The casualties tolled up to 17,000 killed and 70,000 captured.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Alexander's Retreat</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>In July 326 B.C., on the bank of the Beas, the Alexander’s campaign was clogged due to soldiers’ mutiny and they refused to proceed further.</p></li>
<li><p>The Greek writers recorded the reason of the disobedience of the soldiers was merely the war weariness or partly to the fear inspired by the mighty empire of the Nandas.</p></li>
<li><p>The troops were worried, if Alexander met with an accident in course of the campaign what would be the fate of the whole army. They were also afraid of the other unpredictable calamity. Hence, due to refusal of the army, Alexander decided to return.</p></li>
<li><p>Alexander had to fight with a confederacy of republican states led by the Malloi (Malavas) and the Oxydrakai (Kshudrakas) near the confluence of the Jhelum and the Chenab Rivers.</p></li>
<li><p>About 5,000 Brahmans gave up their pen for the sword to save their mother land. All the towns of the Malavas became citadels of resistance.</p></li>
<li><p>Alexander was severely wounded while capturing the town and on this, his soldiers became infuriated and started killing everybody they found, irrespective of age and sex.</p></li>
<li><p>A tribal group, Agalassoi (Arjunayanas), also fought with great courage and showed great bravery, patriotism, and sacrifice when one of their towns was captured by Alexander. All the citizens 20,000 in number threw themselves into the fire with their wives and children.</p></li>
<li><p>Alexander reached Patala and began his homeward journey in September 325 B. C. He proceeded with his army by land, but sent the ships under Nearchus (one of the officers).</p></li>
<li><p>In 324 B.C., Alexander reached Susa in Persia where he died in the next year i.e. 323 BC.</p></li>
<li><p>After Alexander’s death, the Greek edifice collapsed within a short period of time.</p></li>
<li><p>The Greek historians had been thrilled by such victorious campaign and recorded in minute details of the impact of Alexander's Campaign.</p></li>
<li><p>Whereas the Indian sources have remained silent over such a triumphant Campaign because this Campaign touched only the western border of the then India and returned without leaving any lasting impact on Indian people.</p></li>
<li><p>In an Indian context, Alexander's campaign can hardly be called a great military success, as they showed barbarism in the conquest of petty (small) states.</p></li>
<li><p>The conquered region (of Alexander) declared their independence within three months of Alexander's departure from India.</p></li>

<h3>According to Greek and Jain Sources</h3>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Chandragupta took advantage of the disturbances caused by the invasion of Alexander and his sudden death in 323 B.C. in Babylon.</p></li>
<li><p>With the help of Kautilya, Chandragupta raised a large army and launched campaigns. He first overthrew the Greek <i>kshatrapas</i> ruling in the region of north-western India.</p></li>
<li><p>Greek writer Justin, writes, "<i>India after the death of Alexander, had shaken, as it were, the yoke of servitude from its neck and put his Governors to death, and the architect of this liberation was <b>Sandrocottas</b></i>.”</p></li>
<li><p>The Sandrocottas mentioned in the Greek literature has been identified with Chandragupta Maurya.</p></li>
<li><p>After liberating north-western India from the Greek rule, Chandragupta turned his attention towards the conquest of Magadha (where Nanda was the Emperor). However, the details of this conquest are not known.</p></li>
<li><p>According to Parisistha-parvam (the Jain text), Chandragupta with the help of Chanakya, defeated the Nanda king and captured his empire and became the great ruler of Magadha empire.</p></li>
<li><p>Ashoka and his father Bindusara (son of Chandraguptha Maurya) did not make any conquest in south India. Therefore, it was Chandragupta Maurya who made it.</p></li>
<li><p>The Junagarh rock inscription describes that a dam for irrigation was constructed on the <i>Sudarshana</i> Lake by Pushyagupta, a provincial governor of Chandragupta Maurya.</p></li>
<li><p>Inscriptions of Ashoka found at <i>Girnar</i> hills in Junagarh district in Gujarat and at Sopara, in Thane district in Maharashtra reflect that these areas were under the rule of Mauryan Empire.</p></li>
<li><p>In south India, Ashoka's inscriptions have been found at <i>Maski</i>, <i>Yerragudi</i>, and <i>Chitaldurga</i> in Karnataka.</p></li>
<li><p>Rock Edict II and XIII of Ashoka explain that Chandragupta’s immediate neighboring states (in the south) were Cholas, Pandyas, Satyaputras, and Keralaputras.</p></li>
<li><p>The Jain tradition confirms that in his old age, Chandragupta abdicated the throne and retired to <i>Shravanabelagola</i> in Karnataka with his teacher Bhadrabahu (a Jain ascetic).</p></li>
<li><p>Local inscriptions of the later period mentioned that Chandragupta gave up his life as a Jaina devotee by fast unto death at a hill, which later on called as Chandragiri, seems to be named after him.</p></li>
<li><p>In about 305 B.C. Chandragupta defeated the army of the Greek <i>Kshatrapa</i> Seleucus who had succeeded Alexander in the eastern part of his empire.</p></li>
<li><p>The Greek writers stated that a treaty was concluded between Seleucus and Chandragupta in which Seleucus accepted the territories of Kandahar, Kabul, Herat, and Baluchistan and Chandragupta presented him 500 elephants.</p></li>
<li><p>The treaty was followed by a matrimonial alliance between the two in which Seleucus married his daughter to Chandragupta Maurya or to his son Bindusara.</p></li>
<li><p>Seleucus sent Megasthenese as his ambassador to the court of Chandragupta.</p></li>
<li><p>Plutarch writes, "<i>Sandrocottas who had by that time mounted the throne overran and subdued the whole of India with an army of 600,000</i>".</p></li>
<li><p>It is clear that Chandragupta had established a vast empire extended from Afghanistan in the west to Assam in the east and from Kashmir in the north to Karnataka in the south. The entire country except Kalinga was under his rule.</p></li>
<li><p>Bindusara (son of Chandragupta), did not make any conquests. Thereafter, Ashoka (son of Bindusara) is said to have added only Kalinga to the Mauryan-empire.</p></li>

<li><p>Divyavadana mentions that Bindusara appointed his eldest son Sumana (or Susima) as his viceroy at Taxila and Ashoka at Ujjain. It also mentions that when a revolt broke out at Taxila, Ashoka was sent to restore peace as Susima fails to suppress it.</p></li>

<h2>Decline of Mauryan Empire</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Ashoka ruled for almost 40 years and died in 232 B.C.</p></li>

<li><p>In a period of about 50 years after Ashoka’s death, seven kings followed him in succession</p></li>
<li><p>The empire was divided into an eastern and western part. The western part was governed by Kunala, Samprati and others.</p></li>

<li><p>The power and prestige of the Mauryan Empire were challenged by Andhras (in the south India) and continuous attacks of Greek king in the west.</p></li>
<li><p>The king Brihadratha was killed by Pushyamitra who was the commander-in-chief of the army.</p></li>
<li><p>The incident of the killing of the king in full view of the public, and in the presence of his army clearly reflects that the king neither enjoyed the loyalty of his own army nor the sympathy of the people.</p></li>
<li><p>This is the only recorded incident in the history of India till the 12<sup>th</sup> century A.D., wherein the king was murdered and replaced.</p></li>

<h1>Early History of South India</h1>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>During the 1,000 B.C., the present states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala (in southern India) were inhabited by megalithic people.</p></li>
<li><p>The important phase of the ancient history of south India is from the Megalithic period to about A.D. 300.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Megalithic Phase</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The literary meaning of the term megaliths is ‘big stones’ i.e. ‘<i>mega</i>’ means big and ‘<i><b>lit</b></i>’ means stones. But the big stones are not associated with the megalith culture.</p></li>
<li><p>The megalithic culture is known for its burials.</p></li>
<li><p>The abundance of iron tools and a Black-and-Red pottery with the burials is the main identifying features of the megalithic culture.</p></li>
<li><p>The megalithic culture suggests that there was an abrupt change from the Neolithic stage into the Iron Age. And, they did not experience the intermediate Chalcolithic or Bronze Age.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Types of Megalithic Burial</h3>
<p>The following are the major types of Megalithic burial &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p><b>Pit Circle Graves</b> &minus; In this type of burial, the body was first excoriated and then buried. Pots and iron artifacts were placed in a grave. A stone circle is erected around the pit.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/ancient_indian_history/images/pit_circle_graves.jpg" alt="Pit Circle Graves" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p><b>Cists</b> &minus; These graves have a variety of forms. Cists which is stone coffin were made out of granite slabs with one or more capstones, with or without portholes. Cists are fully buried, half buried, or even on the bare rocks. They may contain single or multiple burials. A single or multiple stone circles erected around the cists.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Laterite chambers</b> &minus; In Malabar region, the grave-chambers excavated into laterite instead of granite slabs.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Alignments</b> &minus;  It is a different kind of burial in which a large number of standing stones called ‘<i>Menhirs</i>’ were arranged in squares or diagonals shape. They have been found in Gulbarga district and south of Hyderabad. However, in Kashmir, Menhirs have been found arranged in a semi-circle.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Sacrophagi</b> &minus; These legged urns of terracotta sometimes have animal heads and are not very common.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Urns</b> &minus; The practice of burying excoriated bones in urns seems to be taken from the Neolithic past. They are marked by capstones or stone circles, found mainly on the eastern coast.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Megalithic Tools</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Undoubtedly, there was a wide range of variety in Megalithic construction, but the typical identity was a Black-and-Red ware and distinctive iron tools. They have uniformity all over the peninsula.</p></li>

<li><p>The iron tool includes axes with crossed straps, sickles, tripods, tridents, spearheads, swords, lamp hangers, arrowheads, and lamps.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/ancient_indian_history/images/iron_tools.jpg" alt="Iron Tools" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Horse-harness bits and bells are also common finds.</p></li>
<li><p>Iron Age, in the history of India, is a period when the use of iron for tools and weapons became common, but during this time, the dated literature also began to be written. Therefore, the period of Megalithics marked a point in time where prehistory ends and history begins.</p></li>
<li><p>The builders of these Megalithics remain unknown to northern people because no reference to these monuments has been traced in Sanskrit or Prakrit literature though the early Tamil literature does contain descriptions of these burial practices.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Sources of Megalithic Period</h2>

</li>
<li><p>The Rock Edict II and XIII of Ashoka described the southern kingdoms of Chola, Pandya, Satyaputra, Keralaputra, and Tambapanni.</p></li>
<li><p>Ashoka's kindness to these neighboring states has been very much proved by the fact that he made provisions for medicines and food items etc. for animals and humans of these kingdoms.</p></li>
<li><p>In the <i>Hathigumpha</i> inscription of Kharvela, it has been found that Ashoka was credited for defeating a confederacy of Tamil states.</p></li>
<li><p>A detailed description of south Indian states is found in <i>Sangam</i> literature belonging to the first four centuries of the Christian era.</p></li>
<li><p>The Tamil language is the oldest among the spoken and literary languages of south India. Sangam literature was written in this language.</p></li>
<li><p>The Pandyan kings assembled literary assemblies called as ‘<i>Sangam</i>’.</p></li>
<li><p><i>Sangam</i> literature consisted the collection of verses, lyrics, and idylls, which were composed by poets and scholars.</p></li>

<h2>Satavahanas of Deccan</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Before the emergence of the Satavahanas in Maharashtra and Cholas, Cheras and Pandyas dynasties were ruled southern India the region was settled by megalithic people.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The Satavahanas, also known as ‘<i><b>Andhras</b></i>’ (in Deccan region) covering the parts of Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra was a powerful dynasty.</p></li>
<li><p>The <i>Andhras</i> were ancient people and were mentioned in the <i>Aitareya</i> Brahmana also.</p></li>
<li><p>The Greek writer Pliny mentions that the <i>Andhras</i> were powerful people who possessed a large number of villages and thirty towns, an army of one lakh infantry, two thousand cavalries and one thousand elephants.</p></li>
<li><p>During the Mauryan age, they were part of the Mauryan Empire, but it appears that immediately after the fall of the dynasty, the Andhras declared themselves free.</p></li>
<li><p>Simuka dynasty ruled from 235 B.C. to 213 B.C. and established <i>Simuka</i> dynasty.</p></li>
<li><p>Simuka was succeeded by his brother Krishna.</p></li>
<li><p>Satakarni-I was the third king. He made extensive conquests and performed two <i>Ashvamedhayajna</i>. The <i>Nanaghat</i> inscription described his achievements in details. He conquered western Malwa, Vidarbha, and Anupa (Narmada Valley). He is also referred to as the lord of ‘<i><b>Dakshinapatha</b></i>.’</p></li>
<li><p>Satakarni-I’s name also occurs on one of the gateways of <i>Sanchi</i> stupa because substantial donations were made by the Satavahanas for the renovation and decoration of Sanchi stupas and monasteries.</p></li>
<li><p>Satakarni-II ruled for about 56 years.</p></li>
<li><p>Gautamiputra Satakarni gained Malwa from the Sungas.</p></li>
<li><p>Nahapana had conquered the part of Satavahana territory after Satakarni-II. A large number of coins of Nahapana has been found in Nasik area.</p></li>
<li><p>The Satavahanas became powerful again during the reign of Gautamiputra Satakarni. His achievements are recorded in glowing terms in the Nasik inscription of Queen-mother, Gautami Balasri. This inscription was engraved after his death and in the nineteenth year of the reign of his son and successor Pulmavi II.</p></li>
<li><p>In Nasik inscription, Gautamiputra Satakarni has been described as one who destroyed the Sakas, Yavanas, and Pahlavas. He overthrew Nahapana and restricted a large number of his silver coins. He also recovered northern Maharashtra, Konkan, Vidarbha, Saurashtra, and Malwa from the Sakas.</p></li>
<li><p>Satakarni dedicated a cave in Nasik in the eighteenth year of his reign and granted some land to ascetics in the twenty-fourth year.</p></li>
<li><p>Gautamiputra Satakarni is the first king bearing matronymic and this practice was followed by nearly all his successors.</p></li>
<li><p>Gautamiputra was succeeded by his son Vasisthiputra Sri Pulmavi in about A.D. 130 and ruled for about twenty-four years.</p></li>
<li><p>The coins and inscription of Pulmavi have been found in Andhra Pradesh. This shows that Andhra was the part of Satavahana Empire in the second century A.D. Perhaps, in order to save the Satavahana Empire from the onslaught of the Sakas, Pulmavi married the daughter of Saka ruler Rudradaman. But this Saka king defeated the next Satavahana ruler twice.</p></li>
<li><p>Sri Yajna Satakarni (A.D. 165-195) was perhaps the last of the great Satavahana rulers. His inscriptions have been found in Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh.</p></li>
<li><p>From the distribution of his coins, it appears that he ruled over a large kingdom extending from the Bay of Bengal in the east to the Arabian Sea in the west. Thus he regained the land that the Sakas had conquered from his predecessors.</p></li>
<li><p>Maritime trade and activities during his reign had been proved by the depiction of ship with a fish on his coins.</p></li>
<li><p>The successors of Yajna were weak and unworthy to govern such a large empire. Hence, the Satavahana Empire collapsed especially when Abhiras seized Maharashtra and Ikshvakus and Pallavas appropriated the eastern provinces.</p></li>

<li><p>Asura Naraka had a son namely Bhagadatta who had taken part in the Mahabharata War.</p></li>

<li><p>Rajyavardhana, the elder brother of Harsh was killed deceitfully by the same king of Gauda and Harsha had declared to destroy them. Therefore, this was a coalition between the two kings against their common enemy.</p></li>
<li><p>Banabhatta’s account has disturbed the chronological sequence of the events and therefore some confusion has cropped up about the history of the time.</p></li>

<li><p>Hiuen-Tsang mentioned that King Bhaskaravarma sent a messenger to Silabhadra, the head of Nalanda monastery, to send the 'great pilgrim from China' to him. But this request was compiled only after a threat.</p></li>
<li><p>On the invitation, Hiuen-Tsang visited Kamarupa and stayed there for about a month. Thereafter, Harsha demanded from the king of Kamarupa to send back the Chinese pilgrim to his court. This also complied after a threat to Bhaskaravarma.</p></li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<img src="/ancient_indian_history/images/tripartite_struggle.jpg" alt="Tripartite Struggle" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The tripartite struggle for the supremacy between the Palas, the Gurjara Pratiharas, and the Rashtrakutas was the important event of these centuries.</p></li>
<li><p>The main cause of this struggle was the desire to possess the city of Kanauj, which was then a symbol of sovereignty. And, some other cause of this struggle was to have control over the intermediate fertile regions.</p></li>
<li><p>The shifting of the power among these three was determined both by the internal strength of the respective region and the inability of the rulers to extend their control beyond their respective regions for a longer duration.</p></li>
<li><p>All of the three dynasties (enlisted above) were having more or less same military equipment, administrative machinery, and the strategic concepts.</p></li>
<li><p>The Arab travelers also affirmed that these three powers were equal in strength.</p></li>
<li><p>Because of the balance of power, there was a great political stability within the regions, which nurtured the development of culture and education.</p></li>
<li><p>The first encounter took place among the Pratihara king Vatsaraja, the Pala king Dharmapala, and Rashtrakuta king Dhruva.</p></li>
<li><p>Rashtrakutas achieved a complete victory in the first phase. But the unfortunate death of Dhruva was a great set back to Rashtrakutas.</p></li>
<li><p>Pala king Devapala (A.D. 821-860) was the most prominent in the second phase because his contemporary Pratihara and Rashtrakuta kings were weak rulers.</p></li>
<li><p>Pratihara kings Bhoja (A.D. 836-885) and Mahendrapala (A.D. 885-910) proved to be more powerful in the third phase (during the 9<sup>th</sup> century).</p></li>
<li><p>Each of the three kingdoms Pratiharas, Pala, and Rashtrakutas declined almost simultaneously around the end of the 10<sup>th</sup> century A.D.</p></li>
<li><p>The end of these three dynasties marked the end of the glorious era of more than 300 years.</p></li>
