</ul>
<p>Let us now discuss all of these in detail.</p>
<h2>Atomic Types</h2>
<p>These are defined as basic types in Hybris, which include Java number and string objects – <b>java.lang.integer, java.lang.boolean</b> or <b>java.lang.string</b>.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
&lt;atomictypes&gt;
   &lt;atomictype class = "java.lang.Object" autocreate = "true" generate = "false" /&gt;
   &lt;atomictype class = "java.lang.Boolean" extends = "java.lang.Object" autocreate = "true" generate = "false" /&gt;
   &lt;atomictype class = "java.lang.Double" extends = "java.lang.Number" autocreate = "true" generate = "false" /&gt;
   &lt;atomictype class = "java.lang.String" extends = "java.lang.Object" autocreate = "true" generate = "false" /&gt;
&lt;/atomictypes&gt;
</pre>
<h2>Item Types</h2>
<p>Item types are used to create new tables or to update existing tables. This is considered as a base for a Hybris type system. All new table structures are configured over this type using different attributes as shown below &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
&lt;itemtype code = "Customer" extends = "User" 
   jaloclass = "de.hybris/platform.jalo.user.Customer" autocreate = "true" generate = "true"&gt;
   &lt;attributes&gt;
      &lt;attribute autocreate = "true" qualifier = "customerID" type = "java.lang.String"&gt;
         &lt;modifiers read = "true" write = "true" search = "true" optional = "true"/&gt;
         &lt;persistence type = "property"/&gt;
      &lt;/attribute&gt;   
   &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;/itemtype&gt;
</pre>
<h2>Relation Types</h2>
<p>This type is used to create a link between tables. For example – You can link a country and region.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
&lt;relation code = "Country2RegionRelation" generate = "true" localized = "false" 
   autocreate = "true"&gt;
   
   &lt;sourceElement type = "Country" qualifier = "country" cardinality = "one"&gt;
      &lt;modifiers read = "true" write = "true" search = "true" optional = "false" unique = "true"/&gt;
   &lt;/sourceElement&gt;
   
   &lt;targetElement type = "Region" qualifier = "regions" cardinality = "many"&gt;
      &lt;modifiers read = "true" write = "true" search = "true" partof = "true"/&gt;
   &lt;/targetElement&gt;
&lt;/relation&gt;
</pre>
<h2>Enum Types</h2>
<p>These are used to build enumeration in Java for preparing a particular set of values. For example – Months in a year.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
&lt;enumtype code = "CreditCardType" autocreate = "true" generate = "true"&gt;
   &lt;value code = "amex"/&gt;
   &lt;value code = "visa"/&gt;
   &lt;value code = "master"/&gt;
   &lt;value code = "diners"/&gt;
&lt;/enumtype&gt;
</pre>
<h2>Collection Types</h2>
<p>These are used to build collection/group of element types – group of products, etc.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
&lt;collectiontype code = "ProductCollection" elementtype = "Product" autocreate = "true" generate = "true"/&gt;
&lt;collectiontype code = "LanguageList" elementtype = "Langauage" autocreate = "true" generate = "true"/&gt;
&lt;collectiontype code = "LanguageSet" elementtype = "Langauage" autocreate = "true" generate = "true"/&gt;
</pre>
<h2>Map Types</h2>
<p>Map types are used to store key values pairs in Hybris data modeling. Each key represents its own code.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
&lt;maptype code = "localized:java.lang.String" argumenttype = "Language" 
   returntype = "java.lang.String" autocreate = "true" generate = "false"/&gt;
</pre>

<h1>SAP Hybris - Product for Service</h1>
<p>In SAP Hybris Cloud for Customer, service level defines the time when a ticket for a customer must be responded and completed. Service levels help the organizations define objectives for handling customer messages. Using these, you can measure the performance and the quality of your customer service.</p>
<p>Service levels also help to define new rules as per the ticket category and description whenever a new customer message comes in the C4C system. Using service levels, a system can determine the service level based on those rules and then based on that service level, the initial response and completion due time points are calculated.</p>
<h2>Create a Service Level</h2>
<p>To create a service level, let us follow the steps given below.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; To define Service Levels, go to Administrator &rarr; Service and Social.</p>

<img src="/sap_hybris/images/general.jpg" alt="General" />
<p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; Navigate to the next tab <b>Reaction Times</b>. In this section, you define the time when the service agent responds to the ticket. This time depends on the SLAs (Service Level Agreement) signed with the customer and with the ticket priority and type of customer.</p>
<p><b>Example</b> &minus; High priority ticket will have low response time or high-end customers have low response time. It means, the ticket related to these customers will respond faster when compared to other tickets.</p>
<p>To create a milestone, click Add Row and choose the type of milestone. Select <b>Alert When Overdue</b>, if you want the system to send an automatic alert to the responsible person, when the target milestone-time point is exceeded.</p>
<p>Click on Add Row. Select the milestone as per the business requirement and then click on Alert When Overdue. When you select this option, the system will send an alert to the service agent. Select the required milestones.</p>
<img src="/sap_hybris/images/reaction_times.jpg" alt="Reaction Times" />
<p>To enter the reaction time for all the milestones, go to Details for milestone &rarr; Add Row. Repeat this process for all the above milestones. Select the milestones one by one and then enter the reaction time for these milestones.</p>
<p>To assign a service to the selected milestone (in the Milestones table) click on Add Row. Choose the Type of Service, the Priority and enter the timer (Net Labor Time) duration. Add a row for all the available priorities for each type of service selected.</p>
