<h1>Gymkhana Grid - Overview</h1>

<h2>Faulty Vehicle</h2>
<p>Sometimes a vehicle loses control, goes off the circuit, drastically reduces or increases its speed, spins out of track and even sometimes gets into contact with competing vehicles. The chief steward shall decide the circumstance under which a vehicle will be deemed as at fault. If both vehicles collide and cause damage, then both the vehicle will get a right for 5-minute timeout.</p>

(This doesn’t nullify the 5 minutes timeout for other purpose.) The chief steward has the right to continue the round. The chief steward will reassess the vehicles after the race and if the vehicle is irreparable and the participant is not guilty then the competitor may be declared as the winner.</p>
