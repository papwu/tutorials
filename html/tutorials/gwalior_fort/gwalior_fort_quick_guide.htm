<h1>Gwalior Fort - History</h1>
<p>According to a legend, Gwalior was once ruled by a king named <b>Suraj Sen</b>. A time came when he was suffering from leprosy which was incurable. A sage named <b>Gwalipa</b> gave him water from a sacred pond which cured his disease. In order to honour the sage, the king constructed the fort.</p>
<p>The king got the title of <b>Pal</b> from the sage and a boon that the fort will be in his possession and the generations to come. History says that 83 generations of the king successfully ruled from this fort but the king of 84th generation named <b>Tej Karan</b> could not protect the fort and lost it.</p>
<h2>Gwalior Fort from 6<sup>th</sup> Century to 13<sup>th</sup> Century</h2>
<p>There are inscriptions in the fort which date back to sixth century and indicate that the fort may have been constructed in those times. <b>Mihirakula</b>, a Huna emperor, built a sun temple here.</p>
<p>In 9<sup>th</sup> century, Teli ka Mandir was built by the rulers of <b>Gurjara-Pratihara</b> dynasty. In 10<sup>th</sup> century, Kachchhapghatas controlled the fort. These people worked under the leadership of Chandelas.</p>
<p>In 11<sup>th</sup> century, Muslim dynasties began attacking the fort. <b>Mahmud of Ghazni</b> attacked the fort in 1022AD. <b>Qutubuddin Aibak</b> captured the fort in 1196AD and annexed it to Delhi Sultanate. Though the sultanate lost the fort but was again captured by Iltumish 1232.</p>

His son <b>Ibrahim Lodi</b> attacked the fort in 1516. In this attack, Maan Singh was killed and after a long siege Rajputs surrendered.</p>
<p><b>Mughals</b> captured the fort but lost it to <b>Suris</b>. In 1542, <b>Akbar</b> again captured the fort and made it a prison. He executed his cousin <b>Kamran</b> in the fort. <b>Aurungzeb</b> also killed his brother <b>Murad</b> and his nephews here. After Aurungzeb, Ranas of Gohad captured the fort. They lost to the Marathas and Marathas lost it to British. The British gave the fort to the Ranas of Gohad in 1780.</p>
<img src="/gwalior_fort/images/aurungzeb.jpg" alt="Aurungzeb" />
<p>Marathas again captured the fort in 1784. This time due to the hostility of Ranas of Gohad, British cannot capture the fort. British defeated <b>Daulat Rao Scindia</b> and recaptured the fort later. In 1886, India was in full control of the British so they gave the fort to the Scindias who ruled the fort till 1947.</p>

<img src="/gwalior_fort/images/sas_bahu_temple.jpg" alt="Sas Bahu Temple" />

<h2>Karan Mahal</h2>
<p><b>Kirti Singh</b> built this palace in the fort. He was the second king of Tomar dynasty. <b>Karan Singh</b> was another name of Kirti Singh and so the palace was named as Karan Mahal.</p>
<img src="/gwalior_fort/images/karan_mahal.jpg" alt="Karan Mahal" />
<h2>Vikram Mahal</h2>
<p>Vikramaditya Singh was the elder brother of Man Singh. He constructed Vikram Mahal which was also known as <b>Vikram Mandir</b> because it had a temple of Lord Shiva which was destroyed during the Mughal period. The temple has now been rebuilt in front of the palace.</p>

<h1>Gwalior Fort - Other Monuments</h1>

<h2>Hathi Pol</h2>
<p>Hathi Pol or elephant gate is the main gate through which tourists can enter the fort. This gate also leads to the Man Mandir Palace. The gate is located at the south-eastern part of the fort.

<img src="/gwalior_fort/images/hathi_pol.jpg" alt="Hathi Pol" />
<h2>Chhatri of Bhim Singh Rana</h2>
<p>Bhim Singh Rana belonged to Gohad state and also ruled Gwalior from 1740. He captured Gwalior when Mughal Governor <b>Ali Khan</b> surrendered. Bhim Singh also built a lake named <b>Bhimtal</b> in the fort. The chhatri of Bhim Singh Rana was built by his son and successor <b>Chhatra Singh</b> near the bhimtal. On the occasion of <b>Ram Navami, Jat Samaj Kalyan Parishad</b> organizes a fair every year.</p>
<h2>Gurudwara Data Bandi Chhor</h2>
<p>Gurudwara Data Bandi Chhor was a worship place where <b>Guru Hargobind Singh</b>, the sixth Sikh Guru, used to pray. After Guru Arjun Dev, he was made the sikh guru. Guru Hargobind Singh raised an army to fight the cruelty at that time. He also provided justice to the people at Amritsar. When Jahangir came to know about this, he invited the guru to have a talk with him.</p>
<img src="/gwalior_fort/images/gurudwara_data_bandi_chhor.jpg" alt="Gurudwara Data Bandi Chhor" />
<p>Jahangir was impressed by the guru and both had a good understanding. Once Jahangir fell ill and some people conspired and told that only a holy man can cure him. They suggested the name of Guru Hargobind Singh so Jahangir called him and asked him to live in the Gwalior Fort.</p>
<p>When the wife of Jahangir came to know about the illness of Jahangir, she summoned <b>Sain Mian Mir ji</b> who told that a holy man has been captured so the health of the emperor is declining. When emperor came to know this he ordered the release of the guru. The guru told that he will only leave if 52 other Rajput rulers will also be released. The place in the fort where the guru worshipped came to be known as Gurudwara Bandi Chhor.</p>
