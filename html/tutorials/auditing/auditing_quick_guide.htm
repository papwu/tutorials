<h1>Auditing - Introduction</h1>
<p>The origin of auditing can be traced to Italy. Around the year 1494, Luca Paciolo introduced the double entry system of bookkeeping and described the duties and responsibilities of an Auditor.</p>
<p>Auditing in India has been described in different ways &minus;</p>
<blockquote>“Auditing is a systematic and independent examination of data, statements, records, operations and performances (financial or otherwise) of an enterprise for a stated purpose. In any auditing situation, the Auditor perceives and recognizes the propositions before him for examination, collects evidence, evaluates the same and on this basis, formulates his judgment which is communicated through his audit report.” <p style="text-align:right"> - <b>The Institute of Chartered Accountant of India</b></p></blockquote>
<p>Another definition goes as such &minus;</p>
<blockquote>“Auditing is an intelligent and critical scrutiny of books of accounts of a business with the documents and vouchers from which they have been written up, for the purpose of ascertaining whether the working results of a particular period as shown by Profit and Loss Account and also the financial position as reflected in the Balance-sheet are truly and fairly determined and presented by those responsible for their compilation.” <p style="text-align:right"> - <b>J. R. Batliboi</b></p></blockquote>
<h2>Auditing in India</h2>
<p>Let us now understand the growth of auditing in India. The Indian Companies Act, 1913, prescribed for the first time the qualifications of an Auditor. The Government of Bombay was the first to conduct related courses of study such as the Government Diploma in Accountancy (GDA).</p>
<p>The Auditor’s Certificate Rule was passed in 1932 to maintain uniform standard in Accountancy and Auditing. The Chartered Accountant Act was enacted by the Parliament of India in 1939. The Act regulates that a person can be authorized to audit only when he qualifies in the examinations conducted by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.</p>
<p>Following are a few other points related to Auditing in India &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Members of Institute of Cost and Works Accountant of India are authorized to conduct cost audit according to Section 233-B of the Companies Act, 1956.</p></li>
<li><p>Companies Act 1931 was replaced by Companies Act 1956.</p></li>
<li><p>An Auditor can be appointed only by a special resolution as per section 224 The Companies (amendment) Act, 1974.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Bookkeeping</h2>
<p>A Bookkeeper records day-to-day transaction in the books of accounts in a systematic manner. Bookkeeping includes &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Journalizing</li>
<li>Posting to ledger</li>
<li>Totaling and balancing of ledger accounts</li>
</ul>
<h2>Accountancy</h2>
<p>The job of Accountancy begins where bookkeeping ends and includes the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Rectification of errors</p></li>
<li><p>Preparation of Trial Balance</p></li>
<li><p>Preparation of financial statements (Trading and Profit &amp; Loss account and BalanceSheet, etc.)</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Auditing</h2>
<p>Preparation of accounts is not the duty of an Auditor. “Auditing begins, where accountancy ends”. Auditor is only concerned for checking and verification of records. Auditor is a qualified person appointed for the purpose of certification of work done by others.</p>
<h2>Investigation</h2>
<p>An investigation may be done with a specific purpose. It is usually conducted to know the financial position of a business, extent of fraud and misappropriation and the earning capacity of any business unit, etc. The time duration for investigation may also extend beyond one year. Investigation may not be necessarily done by a qualified Chartered Accountant.</p>
<h2>Qualities of an Auditor</h2>
<p>An Auditor must have the following qualifications and qualities &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>He should be a qualified Chartered Accountant or he should be a qualified member of The Institute of Cost &amp; Works Accountants of India to do cost audit.</p></li>
<li><p>He must have adequate skills and qualities to conduct his work efficiently.</p></li>
<li><p>An Auditor must be honest, impartial and unbiased. He should also be hard-working, have adequate common sense, capacity to hear arguments of others, systematic and methodical.</p></li>
<li><p>An Auditor should ask for clarification on matter on which he is unable to understand the information provided to him.</p></li>
<li><p>His audit report should be correct and clear.</p></li>
<li><p>In case where any suspicious situation arises, he should assume that he is dealing with dishonest and fraudulent peoples.</p></li>
<li><p>He must have thorough knowledge of accounting principles and practices.</p></li>
<li><p>He must have the know how of all the domestic and international court case decisions.</p></li>
<li><p>He must have thorough knowledge of financial management, industrial management and business organizations.</p></li>
<li><p>He must have up-to-date knowledge of the Mercantile law and the Companies Act.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Scope of Auditing</h2>
<p>In comparison with earlier days, where the main objective of auditing was to detect fraud, we now have enhanced ways to determine a true and fair view of financial statements. In recent times, almost every country of the world has introduced various legislations and framed rules and regulation of auditing. In India also legislations related to Tax Audit, Cost Audit, Management Audit and operation Audit, etc. are coming up.</p>
<p>The main purpose of auditing is to certify the correctness of financial statements and to detect errors and frauds.</p>
<h2>Techniques of Auditing</h2>
<p>Following are the common techniques of auditing &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Checking of posting and casting.</li>
<li>Physical verification of assets.</li>
<li>Verification and examination of transactions with available evidences.</li>
<li>Scrutiny of the books of accounts,</li>
<li>Checking of various calculations.</li>
<li>Checking of carried forward balances in next year.</li>
<li>Checking of Bank reconciliation statements.</li>
<li>Auditor can get information from inside and outside sources of organization.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Auditing - Detection and Prevention of Fraud</h1>
<p>The main objective of auditing is to ensure the financial reliability of any organization; detection of fraud is just an incidental object.</p>
<p>Independent opinion and judgement form the objectives of auditing. The job of an Auditor is to ensure that the books of accounts are kept according to the rules stipulated in the Companies Act; an Auditor also needs to ensure whether the books of accounts show a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company or not.</p>
<p>The following are the three distinct types of fraud &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Misappropriation of Cash</li>
<li>Misappropriation of Goods</li>
<li>Manipulation of Accounts</li>
</ul>
<h2>Misappropriation of Cash</h2>
<p>Misappropriation of cash is the easiest way of fraud especially in large business houses where there is limited or no communication between the owner of an organization and the cashier. Following are some of the ways through which embezzlement or misappropriation can be done &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Theft of cash receipts and petty cash and showing fictitious payment to workers, creditors, purchases, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Showing false payments or excess payments in cash book.</p></li>
<li><p>By using the <b>Teeming</b> and <b>Lading</b> method, the money received from any customer can be pocketed and the money received from another customer can be shown as money received from the former.</p></li>
<li><p>Cash sale can be shown as credit sale.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Strict internal control system should be followed in receipts and payments of cash so that the work done by one person should be automatically checked by another person.</p>
<h2>Misappropriation of Goods</h2>
<p>Misappropriation of goods can be done in the following ways &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Goods may be stolen by employees or with the help of employees.</li>
<li>By issuing false credit notes to customer on account of goods return.</li>
</ul>
<p>Detection of misappropriation of goods is more difficult rather than detecting misappropriation of money, especially where management is not much vigilant and sound system of book-keeping, internal control and adequate system of securities are not available.

<h1>Auditing - Detection and Prevention of Errors</h1>
<p>Auditors should be very careful about the detection of errors because manipulation in accounting may also appear as error or it may be a result of carelessness on part of a bookkeeper.</p>
<p>Errors may be broadly classified as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Error of Principle</li>
<li>Errors of Omission</li>
<li>Errors of Duplication</li>
<li>Errors of Commission</li>
<li>Compensating Errors</li>
</ul>
<h2>Error of Principle</h2>
<p>Where the recording of the items of transactions are not done according to the Principle of Accounting, it is known to be an error of principle. These errors are not traceable from trail balance; these errors may be committed unintentionally or for the purpose of manipulation of accounts to inflate or deflate profit.</p>
<p>Following are the examples of such type of errors &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Providing excessive or inadequate depreciation</p></li>
<li><p>Where the provision for outstanding expenses or prepaid expenses is wrong</p></li>
<li><p>Where revenue expenses may be treated as capital expenditure or vice versa</p></li>
<li><p>Where valuation of Plant & Machinery, Stock, investment and other assets are not done according to the Principle of Accounting.</p></li>
<li><p>Where income received is credited to personal account of the person who is making the payment; for example, commission received from Mr. A credited to Mr. A’s account instead of the commission account, it will increase creditors in the BalanceSheet and reduce profit in the Profit & Loss account.</p></li>
<li><p>Where the payment of expenses is posted to the personal account of a person who receives payment; for example, the rent paid to Mr. A wrongly debited to Mr. A’s account, it will increase profit and also increase debtors in the Balance-sheet.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Errors of Omission</h2>
<p>There may be two types of omission of entry while recording the transactions in the books of accounts;</p>
<ul class="list">

<li><p>Where payment or receipt transaction omitted to be recorded in ledger account from cash book.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Errors of Duplication</h2>
<p>The detection of error of duplication is very difficult. It might be detected with proper and minute observation of accounts; for example, purchase may be recorded twice with original and duplicate copy of purchase invoice, etc. It is also possible to post the total of any ledger account twice in the trial balance.</p>
<h2>Errors of Commission</h2>
<p>Error of commission occurs the entry made in the books of the original entry or the ledger account is wrong. Let us see the following examples &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Purchase of goods for Rs. 25,000 wrongly entered as Rs. 2,500 in purchase book.</p></li>
<li><p>Credit purchase from AB Company wrongly credited to BA Company’s account.</p></li>
<li><p>Wrong totaling  &minus; total of purchase day book is totaled as Rs. 1,12,500 instead of 1,21,500.</p></li>
<li><p>Purchase from AB Company wrongly debited to AB company account instead of crediting AB company account and debiting purchase account.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Compensating Errors</h2>
<p>When the effect of an error compensates with another error; it is known to be a compensating error. Such errors do not affect the trial balance; for example, total of a debit account as well as credit account totaled short by Rs. 7,500. This type of error will compensate both.</p>
<h2>Prevention of Errors and Fraud</h2>
<p>After the completion of audit, the Auditor can suggest his client to make changes in the accounting systems and also to improve his internal control system as an Auditor cannot do anything directly to prevent errors and frauds.</p>

</ul>
<p>Following stakeholders are covered under the statutory or compulsory audit.</p>
<h3>Audit of Companies</h3>
<p>First time in India, the Indian Companies Act, 1913 made it compulsory for joint stock companies to get their accounts audited by a qualified person (chartered accountant). Appointments, duties, qualifications, powers and liabilities are amended through the Companies Act, 1956 and 2013.</p>
<h3>Audit of Trust</h3>
<p>The Public Trust Act provides compulsory audit of accounts by a qualified Auditor. Conditions and terms as laid down in Trust deed are the basis on which accounts of trusts are maintained. Any Beneficiary of trust does not have control or access over accounts of trust, therefore, there are more chances of fraud and misappropriations.</p>
<h3>Audit of Co-operative Societies</h3>
<p>The Companies Act is not applicable to societies; co-operative societies are established under the Co-operative Societies Act, 1912. It is a must for a qualified accountant to have the required expertise and he should be updated with various amendment of the Act. An Auditor should also have knowledge of the by-laws of this act.</p>
<h3>Audit of other Institutions</h3>
<p>Banks, Insurance companies and Electricity companies are audited as per the provisions of special Act of the Parliament.</p>
<h2>Cost Audit</h2>
<blockquote><i>“Cost audit would apparently mean an examination of Cost books, Cost Accounts, Cost Statements and Subsidiary and prime documents with a view to satisfy the Auditor that these represent a fair and true view of the cost of production. This will naturally mean an examination of appropriateness of the cost accounting system adopted by business and effectiveness of its implementation.” </i>
<p style="text-align:right">- <b>J.G. Tickhe</b></p></blockquote>
<p>Services of qualified cost accountants are necessary to have full control on the records of costs and cost variations. Big business houses and manufacturing units do understand the importance of cost accounting. Cost Auditors check the work done by Cost Accountants to ensure correctness of the accounting.</p>
<h3>Objectives of Cost Audit</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>To verify arithmetical accuracy of cost accounting.</li>
<li>To help management to take decision about production and cost variations.</li>
<li>To detect error and frauds.</li>
<li>To have control over cost accounting department.</li>
<li>To give suggestions about efficiency of material, labour and machine.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tax Audit</h2>
<p>Under the provision of section 44AB of the Income Tax Act, 1961, every person carrying a business/Profession is required to get his accounts audited, if the total turnover or gross receipts during the previous year exceed Rs. 100 lacs in case of business and Rs. 25 lacs in case of profession.</p>
<p>Profit and Loss account of a business or profession is adjusted according to the provision of the Income Tax Act, therefore accounting profit and tax profit differ. The reason behind the difference in profit or loss may be because of the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Amount of depreciation</p></li>
<li><p>Under the Income Tax Act, certain expenses are allowed only on the basis of actual payment and those should be within the prescribed time as provided by law, like the payment of Provident Fund, ESI, Interest to financial institutions, VAT/Central Sales Tax, Employees related payments, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Balance Sheet Audit</h2>
<p>Balance sheet audit is very popular in the United States of America. Balance sheet audit is an annual audit and it covers each and every item of nominal accounts as appeared in profit and loss account, assets, liabilities, reserves, provisions, stocks and surplus. Balance sheet audit is also done by highly-skilled accountants.</p>
<h2>Continuous Audit</h2>
<p>Under continuous audit each and every transaction of the business is checked by the Auditor regularly. Continuous audit is required in large organizations where number of transactions is very high, internal control system is not effective, periodicals  statements are required and final accounts are prepared immediately after the close of financial years like banks.</p>
<p><b>Advantages</b> &minus; Complete checking of records, up-to-date accounts, moral-check on staff and early finalization of financial statements are the main advantages of continuous audit.</p>
<p><b>Disadvantages</b> &minus; High cost of continuous audit, mechanical work of Auditor, chances of unhealthy relations with staff due to frequent visits, etc., are main disadvantages of continuous audit.</p>
<h2>Annual Audit</h2>
<p>In an organization where the number of transactions is not large, an Auditor usually comes after the close of financial year and completes his audit work in continuous session. In case of small business houses, annual audit gives satisfactory results.</p>
<p><b>Advantages</b> &minus; The work that is done by an Auditor in Annual Auditing does not affect the everyday routine of the organization and its people; the Auditor has full control over financial statements and records. Among other advantages, Annual Audit is cost-effective.</p>
<p><b>Disadvantages</b> &minus; There might come instances where the unavailability of Auditor may cause unnecessary delay in audit work; due to complete audit in one sitting, chances of undetected errors and frauds are high. This is not recommended for big business houses and the delay in annual general meeting is sometimes due to delay in audit which turns out to be a major disadvantage of annual audit.</p>
<h2>Partial Audit</h2>
<p>Partial audit is done only for a specific purpose; for example, to check the receipt side or the payment side of the cash book, to check cash sale, to check purchases or expenses only. The reason for calling out for a Partial Audit largely depends on the Management of the organization.</p>
<h2>Internal Audit</h2>
<p>Internal audit may be done by an independent person or by the employees of the company; internal Auditor may or may not be qualified person for audit. Internal audit is continuous in nature. As per section 144 of the Companies Act, an internal Auditor cannot render his services as Statutory Auditor for the same company.</p>
<p>As per the new section 138 of the Companies Act, internal audit has been made compulsory for certain categories of companies;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Certain class of companies or may be prescribed shall be required to appoint an internal Auditor, who shall either be a chartered accountant or cost accountant or such other professional as may be decided by the Board to conduct internal audit of the functions and activities of the company.</p></li>
<li><p>The central Government, may, by rules, prescribed the manner and intervals in which the internal audit shall be conducted and reported to the Board.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following classes of companies are required to appoint an internal Auditor &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Listed companies.</p></li>

<h1>Auditing - Types of Evidence</h1>
<p>In this chapter, let us understand the different types of evidence used in Auditing.</p>
<h2>Accounting System</h2>
<p>Accounting System of an organization must be reliable. On the basis of flow chart, the Auditor may come to know about the documents which originate at each state of transaction. Reliability of the internal control system in organization will decide the acceptability of evidence originating from the accounting system.</p>
<h2>Physical Evidence</h2>
<p>Physical Evidence is important in case of tangible assets. Physical verification can prove the actual existence of tangible assets like, land, building, plant and machinery, furniture and fixture, cash-in hand and stocks, etc.</p>
<h2>Documentary Evidence</h2>
<p>Documentary Evidence is very important and most of the evidence is in the form of documents. The following are the different types of documentary evidence &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Documents that originated outside the organization but have been held by the client; for example, fixed deposit certificate is an evidence of deposit in bank.</p></li>
<li><p>Cheques issued by the client is the second type of evidence which originated from within the organization but circulated to outsiders.</p></li>
<li><p>Salary paid to employees is supported by salary sheet, time card, etc. This type of evidence is availed from within the organization and supported by internal control system.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Journals and Ledgers</h2>
<p>Basic entries in journals are booked and supported by source documents like sale invoices, purchase invoice, payment advice, etc.</p>
<p>Ledger are books of final entry supported by journal book.</p>
<p>A Ledger is the base of financial statements like Trading Account, Profit and Loss Account and Balance Sheet.</p>
<h2>Oral Evidence</h2>
<p>Discussion with different officers of an organization is the basis for generation of some oral evidence. The Auditor should carefully observe if there is any inconsistency; he should look in to it.</p>
<h2>Subsequent Events</h2>
<p>Subsequent events after the <b>Date of Balance Sheet</b> are also very important evidences; for example, huge deposits before balance sheet date and huge withdrawals after balance sheet date put a question mark on bank’s performance.</p>
<h2>Circumstantial Evidence</h2>
<p>Circumstantial evidence is not direct evidence but related to circumstances. For example, if any employee of a company spends hefty amount on any marriage, party or purchases a luxury apartment or car which is not possible with the income that he receives from his salary, it creates an uncertainty of something being wrong. An Auditor should make use  of circumstantial evidence if he needs certain facts.</p>
<h2>Ratios</h2>
<p>If the Auditor finds any variation in the financial ratios, then he should look into it carefully. Comparison in ratio may be for same organization for different periods or it may be a comparison between two organizations.</p>
<h2>Computerized Records</h2>
<p>Evidences will remain same even in case of that organisation where computerised accounting system is maintained.</p>
<h1>Auditing - Audit Techniques</h1>
<p>Evidences are very important for an Auditor to form an opinion regarding financial statements. If Auditor fails to collect proper evidence, it will reduce the reliability of audit report. The method of collecting evidence is called audit technique. Following are a few important audit techniques &minus;</p>
<h2>Vouching</h2>
<p>When the Auditor verifies accounting transactions with documentary evidence, it is called vouching. Through vouching, the Auditor verifies authority and authenticity of records.</p>
<h2>Confirmation</h2>
<p>Confirmation is a technique used by an Auditor to validate the correctness of the transactions; for example, an Auditor obtains written statement directly from debtors to confirm the debtors balance as appeared in the books of client.</p>
<h2>Reconciliation</h2>
<p>Reconciliation is a technique used by an Auditor to know the reason of differences in balances. For example, to know the difference in the bank book of the client and the bank balance as appeared in the bank statement or pass book, the Auditor prepares the reconciliation statement. The same method may be used for debtors, creditors, etc.</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>Testing is a technique of selecting representative transactions out of whole accounting data to draw a conclusion about all items.</p>
<h2>Physical Examination</h2>
<p>Physical examination requires verification and confirmation of the physical existence of tangible assets as appears in the Balance Sheet like cash in hand, land and building, plant and machinery, etc.</p>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>Analysis is technique used by an Auditor to segregate important facts and to further study their relationship.</p>
<h2>Scanning</h2>
<p>By scanning of books of accounts, an experienced Auditor can identify those entries which would require his attention. It is also called scrutiny of accounts.</p>
<h2>Inquiry</h2>
<p>This method is used to collect in-depth information about any transaction.</p>
<h2>Verification of Posting</h2>
<p>To verify posting from books of original entry to ledger account and confirm the balance, an Auditor is required to verify the postings; for example, to verify a sale book, an Auditor may verify postings from the sale register to the sale ledger. He may further calculate balances of the sale register and the sale book.</p>
<h2>Flow Chart</h2>
<p>The Flow Chart technique is used by an Auditor to determine the stages of transaction and the generation of documents at all levels of transactions.</p>

<li><p>Since internal control system is involved in routine transactions, irregular transactions may be overlooked.</p></li>
<li><p>Changes in conditions may affect the effectiveness of internal control system.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Scope of Internal Control</h2>
<p>Following are the main areas which are generally covered by a good internal control system &minus;</p>

</ul>
<h1>Auditing - Internal Check and Auditor</h1>
<p>The nature and extent of the scope of the Auditor’s work depends upon the system of Internal Check in an organization. The system of Internal Check will determine the reliability on work which an Auditor can place. The External Auditor is ultimately responsible for the final accounts.</p>  
<p>The Internal Check system cannot relieve the Auditor of his contractual responsibilities in case anything goes wrong in the final accounts, therefore it is the duty of the Auditor to check the whole transaction in detail. A good Internal Check system may relieve the Auditor of detailed checking and he can utilize the saved time to any other work of more importance.</p>

<h1>Auditing - Audit Sampling</h1>
<p>These days, auditors may not go for detailed examination and verifications of records. With the introduction of efficient internal control system in organizations, Auditors pick selective portion of entries out of complete data for making judgement on the complete data.</p>
<p>Checking of all transaction and verifying entries and record of the business was a common practice in earlier years; this is almost obsolete in the present modern system of auditing. Since there is no statutory obligation for the Auditor to check whole transactions, thus the Auditor decides at his own level about the extent to which checking should be applied.</p>
<h2>What is Audit Sampling?</h2>
<p>Sampling is a technique, based on the assumption that, by and large, every sample has almost the same characteristics of the complete data it is representing. Sampling means the selection and verification of a portion of accounting entries and records out of total similar data. It provides reasonable basis to the Auditor to conclude about the population.</p>
<p>An Auditor may apply <b>test checks</b> where adequate internal control system is adopted by the organization and it is widely accepted in accounting and auditing profession. In it, the Auditor goes for selective verification instead of checking all the entries in the books.</p>
<p>No doubt, this technique may provide a certain degree of reliability instead of complete reliable results. If, there is a satisfactory internal control system in any organization, a lesser degree of reliability of sample result may be acceptable.</p>
<h3>Test Checking</h3>
<p>Nature, size and materiality of transactions are the basis, which are kept by the Auditor in his mind for his own judgements for selecting a sample of entries to be checked. Normally, accounts having material impact and entries involving large amounts are checked thoroughly and balance entries are checked on at random basis.</p>
<p>The advantage of this technique is that if any error or fraud detected out of unchecked entries will not create any material impact on fairness and truth of financial statements. Disclosure, presentation, accounting standards, provision of law and arithmetical accuracy are other aspects on the basis of which, the Auditor gives his judgement.</p>
<h3>Precautions</h3>
<p>Following precautions must be taken to apply test checking technique.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Selected transactions for test check plan should be free from any bias.</p></li>
<li><p>Number of transactions includes in test check should be on the basis of the experience of an Auditor.</p></li>
<li><p>Purpose of voucher checking should be based on the clear objectives of authorization or payment made or recording in the books.</p></li>
<li><p>Transactions might be classified in sub-group, in case where, there is a wide variety of transactions in a group.</p></li>
<li><p>Some transactions should be identified during audit and those are to be checked thoroughly.</p></li>
<li><p>During audit, if any error or fraud is identified, those should be further investigated thoroughly.</p></li>
<li><p>Internal control system of organization should be studied thoroughly to decide at what extent the test checks are to be applied.</p></li>
<li><p>Complete procedures and processing of transactions should be studied from starting to end.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>What is Statistical Sampling?</h2>
<p>Statistical sampling refers to an approach to sampling that has the following characteristics &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Random selection of sample items, and</p></li>
<li><p>The use of probability theory to evaluate sample results, including measurement of sampling risk.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Sampling without the above characteristics is to be considered as a non-statistical approach. Whatever may be the sampling approach, the sample must be similar to the larger data it represents?  Non-statistical sampling is neither scientific nor objective. Reliability of audit objectives can be measured in statistical sampling.</p>
<h3>Advantages of Statistical Sampling</h3>
<p>Following are the advantages of Statistical Sampling &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Increase in the size of population does not mean increase in sample size.</p></li>
<li><p>Indication of specific risk and precision are associated with estimation of minimum sample size.</p></li>
<li><p>This technique is free from any association of human bias.</p></li>
<li><p>With minimum efforts, cost and time, it provides maximum information.</p></li>
<li><p>Sample represents the whole population.</p></li>
<li><p>For verification of work-in-progress and inventory, it is a very useful technique because total errors can be predicted on the basis of errors in the sample.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>Following are the limitations of statistical sampling &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Without effective and adequate internal control system, this technique cannot work properly.</p></li>
<li><p>Without adequate size and sample, result of it can be misleading.</p></li>
<li><p>This technique requires more time and energy which is not practical in certain situations.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Prerequisites of Statistical Sampling</h3>
<p>Following are the prerequisites of Statistical Sampling &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Every item in population has equal chance of selection for sampling and each selected item for sample is of equal importance.</p></li>
<li><p>There must be an appropriate size of sample to enable the Auditor to form an opinion about the genuinity of financial statements.</p></li>
<li><p>Sample should be representative of the whole population.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Important Points From SA-530</h2>
<p>Let us now discuss a few important points from SA-530.</p>
<h3>Sample design, size and selection of items for testing</h3>
<p>When designing an audit sample &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>the Auditor shall consider the purpose of the audit procedures and the characteristics of the population from the which the sample will be drawn.</p></li>
<li><p>the Auditor shall determine a sample size sufficient to reduce sampling risk to an acceptably low level.</p></li>
<li><p>the Auditor shall select items for the sample in such a way that each sampling unit in the population has a chance of selection.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Performing Audit Procedures</h3>
<p>The Auditor shall perform audit procedures, appropriate to the purpose, on  each item selected. If the audit procedure is not applicable to the selected item, the Auditor shall perform the procedures on a replacement item.</p>
<p>It the Auditor is unable to apply the designed audit procedures, or suitable alternative procedures, to a selected item, the Auditor shall treat that item as a deviation from the prescribed control, in the case of tests of controls, or a misstatement, in the case of tests of details.</p>
<h3>Nature and cause of deviation and misstatement</h3>
<p>The Auditor shall investigate the nature and causes of any deviations or misstatements identified, and evaluate their possible effect on the purpose of the audit procedure and on other areas of the audit.</p>
<p>In extremely rare circumstances when the Auditor considered a misstatement or deviation discovered in a sample to be an anomaly, the Auditor shall obtain a high degree of certainty that such misstatement or deviation is not representative of the population. The Auditor shall obtain this degree of certainty by performing additional audit procedures to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence that the misstatement or deviation does not affect the reminder of the population.</p>
<h3>Projecting Misstatement</h3>
<p>For the test of details, the Auditor shall project misstatements found in the sample to the population.</p>

<h1>Auditing - Audit Vouching</h1>
<p>Accounting entries made in the books must be supported by documentary evidence and inspection of that evidence is called vouching. The Auditor judges the authenticity, of the accounting entries using the technique of vouching. In case of unavailability of proper supporting documents, the Auditor may have all reasons to doubt about errors or fraud or manipulation.</p>  
<p>Thus, auditing is incomplete without vouching.</p> 
<p>In auditing process, based on evidence, there are two main functions</p> 
<ul class="list">
<li><p>collection of evidences &minus; through observation, confirmation, inspection, inquiry.</p></li>
<li><p>evaluation of evidences &minus; with relevance, adequacy and validity.</p></li>

<li><p>If adequate internal control system exists, the Auditor may choose to do test checking instead of complete vouching.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Vouching and Routine Checking</h2>
<p>Routine checking covers the checking of every carry forward, posting to ledger account and balancing of account. Vouching includes routine checking which is a mechanical checking, whereas vouching is made on the basis of documentary evidence.</p>

<h2>Prepaid Expenses</h2>
<p>These expenses are paid in advance for next coming year(s), hence should not be debited to profit and loss account of current year to arrive at true financial results.</p>
<p>For example; Insurance of Fixed assets is normally paid on annual basis and if we paid insurance premium in the month of October for one year, then insurance for this current year will be calculated from October to March and from April to September it will be treated as prepaid insurance. Prepaid insurance will be shown as prepaid expenses under the head of current assets in the balance sheet.</p>
<p>Auditor should vouch every nominal account to confirm whether correct amount of expenses is debited to profit and loss account or not. Other examples of prepaid expenses are &minus;</p>

<h2>Deferred Revenue Expenditure</h2>
<p>The examples of deferred revenue expenditure have been described below &minus;</p>
<h3>Preliminary Expenditure</h3>
<p>Preliminary expenditure is incurred at the time of incorporation of a new company. These expenses are of heavy amount and are incurred mainly for promotional reasons. Nature of these expenses are capital but not actually represent any asset, hence should be written off from profit and loss account over a period of 3 to 10 years in equal installments.</p>
<h3>Advertising and Sales Promotion</h3>
<p>These expenses are incurred at the time of establishing new business or at the time of introduction of any new product in the market. These expenses are shown as assets in Balance sheet and should be written off in profit and Loss account over a numbers of accounting periods.</p>
<h3>Heavy Repairs</h3>
<p>Expenses of heavy repairs of fixed assets shall not be debited to profit and loss account of year in which these expenses incurred but it should be spread to number of years like other deferred revenue expenses. Heavy amount of expenses is incurred on repair of Plant &amp; Machinery due to increased production capacity of the plant or to maintain current production capacity of machine which is very old and need some heavy overhauling or repairing to increase it life.</p>
<p>Other examples of deferred revenue expenses are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Discount allowed on debentures</li>
<li>Experimental expenditure</li>
<li>Research &amp; development expenses</li>
<li>Development expenses on mines</li>
</ul>
<h2>Outstanding Liabilities</h2>
<p>There are some expenses and liabilities that come up in due course of business; these are due for payment but not paid till the end of accounting period in question. The Auditor should see all those expenses and liabilities and all these expenses should be included in profit and loss of the current year to arrive at the true profit or loss of the firm.</p>
<p>Following are the main examples of outstanding expenses and liabilities &minus;</p>
<h3>Audit Fees</h3>
<p>Audit fees are debited to profit and loss account of the same year for which audit is conducted. No doubt main audit work start after the close of financial year and finalization of financial statements are done in next financial year but it is a widely accepted practice to do so. It is also argued that audit fee should be debited to the profit and loss account in the next year in which the audit work is actually performed. In the first case, audit fees will be debited and the audit fees payable will be credited.</p>
<h3>Purchases</h3>
<p>In case where the purchased goods are received in the current financial year and invoices for the same are received in next year, purchase should be debited and outstanding liabilities should be credited.</p>
<h3>Rent</h3>
<p>Rent on factory premises, office building, godown, etc. is payable on monthly basis. The Auditor should confirm that any unpaid amount of rent for the last month of the financial year or any other month of financial year in question should be added to rent of the current year and the rent payable should be shown as current liabilities.</p>
<h3>Commission on Sale</h3>
<p>Commission on sale is payable to agent, director or salesmen on the basis of sales. Auditor should check the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Sale agreement</p></li>

</ul>
<h3>Interest</h3>
<p>The Auditor should carefully examine the interest on loan from bank, loan from outsider parties, unsecured loan, financial institutions, term loan and interest on debentures. He should see that the provision for interest payable should be duly provided in the books of accounts according to the applicable rate of interest.</p>
<h3>Salary and wages</h3>
<p>Salary and wages for the last month of the accounting year is normally paid in the next financial year. The Auditor should confirm that the salary and wages for last month should be debited to salary and wages account and credited to salary &amp; wages payable account.</p>
<h3>Cartage and Freight</h3>
<p>Transporters normally provide bills for transportation charges after closing of financial year. It is a duty of an Auditor to take these expenses in the current financial year creating liabilities for the same.</p>
<h3>Contingent Liabilities</h3>
<p>Contingent liability may be payable in future or may not be payable in future it depends on the event. For example, if any person filed a suit against company, possibilities are there, it may be in favor of company or it may be against the company, in case it will decide against the company, company has to pay such amount of suit as the court decides. Therefore, contingent liabilities are said to be possible liabilities.</p>
<p>In case of above, no actual provision is made in the books of account but as a footnote of Balance sheet, it is compulsory to show the probable amount of liabilities.</p>
<h3>Contingent Assets</h3>
<p>Contingent assets are not shown as footnote of the balance sheet. Following are the examples of Contingent Assets &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Claim for the refund of the Income Tax, Sales Tax, Excise Duty, etc.</li>
<li>Uncalled share capital of the company.</li>

</ul>
<h1>Auditing - Audit Verification</h1>
<p>Verification means the inspection of assets appearing in financial statements, whether the assets are according to legislation or not. Verification of assets and liabilities are done to confirm the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Existence</li>
<li>Ownership</li>
<li>Proper valuation</li>
<li>Possession</li>
<li>Freedom from encumbrances</li>
<li>Proper recording</li>
</ul>
<h2>Objectives of Verification</h2>
<p>Following are the objectives of Verification &minus;</p>

<li><p>Legal and official documents relating to assets are checked to confirm the ownership of assets.</p></li>
<li><p>It is confirmed that assets are free from any charge of lien.</p></li>
<li><p>Proof regarding proper valuation of assets.</p></li>
<li><p>To confirm that assets are properly accounted for in the books of accounts.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Vouching and Verification</h2>
<p>Both are considered to be same thing but there are lots of difference between vouching and verification.</p>
<p>Vouching relates to confirmation of the correctness and authenticity of accounting entries as appeared in the books of accounts whereas verification confirms  the existence, ownership and  valuation of assets as appears in the balance sheet. The Auditor’s duty is not only vouching the entries appearing in the books because vouching cannot prove the existence of the related asset or liabilities at the balance sheet date.</p>
<h2>Verification of Liabilities</h2>
<p>Following are the objectives of verification of liabilities &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Creditors reflect a true position as to liabilities of the business.</p></li>
<li><p>All liabilities are disclosed in the balance sheet whether recorded in the books or not.</p></li>
<li><p>Value of liabilities is according to the generally accepted accounting principles.</p></li>
<li><p>Liabilities are properly classified and disclosed in the balance sheet.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Confirmation and Verification</h2>
<p>Let us now understand what confirmation and verification is.</p>
<h3>Confirmation</h3>
<p>Auditor requires confirmation from third party and management about any fact or figure. Few of the examples in which the Auditor requires confirmations are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Confirmation from debtors about balances.</p></li>
<li><p>Confirmation from creditors about balances.</p></li>
<li><p>Confirmation from banks about bank balances, fixed deposits, interest accrued, overdraft or cash credit limit balance, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Confirmation from financial institutions about loan and interests.</p></li>
<li><p>Confirmation from management about contingent liabilities, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Verification</h3>
<p>Verification means inspection of assets by the Auditor and it includes identification, weighing and counting of assets. Following items require physical verification &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Land and Building</li>
<li>Plant and Machinery</li>
<li>Stock-in-hand</li>
<li>Stores and consumables</li>
<li>Investments</li>
<li>Securities</li>
<li>Cash-in-hand</li>
<li>Bills receivable</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, confirmation and verification are altogether different processes of audit and both are equally important too.</p>
<h2>Valuation of Assets and Liabilities</h2>
<p>Valuation means estimation of various assets and liabilities. It is the duty of Auditor to confirm that assets and liabilities are appearing in the balance sheet exhibiting their proper and correct value. In the absence of proper valuation of assets and liabilities, they will exhibit either overvalued or under-valued.</p>
<p>It is therefore required for an Auditor to exercise reasonable care and skill to analyze the basis of valuation from technical experts and satisfy himself that assets shown in Balance-sheet are properly valued accordance with the generally accepted conventions and accounting principles.</p>
<h2>Components of Valuation</h2>
<p>Methods of valuation of assets are as hereunder &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Cost Price</b> &minus; This is the cost price paid at the time of acquisition of assets plus the freight charges, octroi charges, and commissioning and installation charges, etc. to bring that asset in usable condition.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Book Value</b> &minus; This is the value as appearing in the books of accounts; the cost price less depreciation.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Realizable Value</b> &minus; A Value which can be realized from the sale of assets.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Market Value</b> &minus; A value which the asset can fetch at the time of sale.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Replacement Value</b> &minus; A value on which an asset can be replaced.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Conventional Value</b> &minus; It means the cost price less depreciation written off ignoring any kind of fluctuation in the price.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Scrap Value</b> &minus; If the asset is not in working condition and sold as scrap, then the sale value of asset is scrap value.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Auditor should ensure that the basis of valuation is correct and reliable. He should keep in mind the process of valuation which is as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Original cost</li>
<li>Expected working hours of the assets</li>
<li>Wear and tear expenses</li>
<li>Scrap value</li>
<li>Chances of asset become obsolete</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixed asset is valued at cost price less depreciation and current assets should be valued at cost or market price whichever is less.</p>
<h2>Vouching, Verification and Valuation</h2>
<p>In vouching, accounting entries are checked with the bona-fide vouchers.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Verification proves the <b>existence, ownership</b> and <b>title</b> of assets.</p></li>
<li><p>Valuation certifies the <b>correct value of asset</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Vouching is done after <b>original entry</b> in the books of accounts.</p></li>
<li><p>Verification and valuation are done at the <b>end of the financial year</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Vouching is done by <b>Senior Auditor</b> and <b>Audit Clerk</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Verification and valuation are done by the <b>Auditor</b> himself.</p></li>
<li><p>Bonafide vouchers are sufficient <b>evidence</b> for vouching</p></li>
<li><p>For Valuation Auditor has to depend upon <b>certification</b> from owner/partner/director.</p></li>
<li><p>Verification is done by physical verification, title deeds and receipt of payment, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Verification and Valuation of Copyright</h2>
<p>We will now discuss the verification and valuation of Copyright &minus;</p>
<h3>Copyright</h3>
<p>Copyright provides legal protection and legal rights to an author by which the publication of his work by another is prohibited. Copyright remains with the author for lifetime and even 50 years after his death.</p>

<li><p>The Auditor should examine the agreement between the author and the publisher.</p></li>
<li><p>If there are numbers of copyright with the same publisher. Auditor should ask for the schedule of copyrights.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Valuation of Copyright</h3>
<p>Copyrights lose their value over a passage of time; hence the value of copyright is not stable. In case where the sale of publication is very low or nil, value of copyright should be written off.</p>
<p>Value of copyright in the Balance-sheet will be shown as <i>cost less</i> the value written off.</p>
<h2>Verification and Valuation of Fixed Assets</h2>
<p>We will discuss the verification and the valuation of different fixed assets &minus;</p>

<li><p>If Auditor feels necessary he can obtain certificate from legal advisor about the validity of title deed of the client.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Valuation of Building</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Building should always be valued at <i>cost less</i> depreciation.</p></li>
<li><p>Although the market value of building may be much higher than the cost, still depreciation on building should be provided.</p></li>
<li><p>Depreciation will be provided even if building is not in use.</p></li>
<li><p>Market or releasable value should not be taken into account because both are fluctuating.</p></li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2>Verification and Valuation of Current Assets</h2>
<p>We will now discuss the verification and valuation of a few important current assets, cash and bank balance and sundry debtors.</p>
<h3>Cash-in-hand</h3>
<p>Cash-in-hand is verified by actual counting of cash. Cash-in-hand should be verified at the close of the business or on the date of the balance sheet. Counting of cash must be done in the presence of cashier. If physically verification of cash is not feasible for an Auditor due to branch located abroad or in remote area, the Auditor should ask the cashier to deposit all his Cash-in-hand in bank account on the last date.</p> 
<p>It is the primary duty of an Auditor to verify the cash-in-hand and in case of non verification, the Auditor will be held responsible for breach of his duty. If there is heavy cash balance in hand at any time, the Auditor should immediately inform the management beforehand.</p> 
<p>If the cashier is made accountable for payment to employees or others, the Auditor should carefully verify the same.</p>
<h3>Cash at Bank</h3>
<p>The Auditor needs to consider the following points for verification of cash at bank &minus;</p>

<h1>Depreciation, Reserves and Provision</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss auditing related to Depreciation, Reserves and Provision. We will proceed by discussing Depreciation and move on to discussing Reserves and Provision further.</p>
<h2>What is Depreciation?</h2>
<p>Value of depreciation reduces the value of assets on residual basis and also the current year profits.</p>
<p>Depreciation indicates the reduction in value of any fixed assets. Reduction in value of assets depends on the life of assets. Life of assets depends upon the usage of assets.</p>
<p>There are many deciding factors which ascertain the life of assets;  in case of a building, the deciding factor is  time, the deciding factor for leased assets is the lease period, the deciding factor for plant and machinery is both production and time. There may be many factors but ascertainment of life should be based on some reasonable basis.</p>
<h2>Reason of Depreciation</h2>
<p>Following are the main causes of depreciation &minus;</p>
<h3>Wear and Tear</h3>
<p>One of the main reasons of depreciation is normal wear &amp; tears, it depends upon the usage of machinery. More the machinery is in use, more will be the wear and tear. Wear and tear of a machine in use for one shift will be less than with a machine being used in two shifts.</p>
<h3>Exhaustion</h3>
<p>Some assets may lose their value due to consumption, for example, mines, quarries, oil walls and forest stands. Due to continuous extraction a stage will come where all above are completely exhausted</p>
<h3>Obsolescence</h3>
<p>New technology or invention may bring down the value of old asset and outdated technology become cheaper. For example, television became obsolete with the introduction of new LED Television, the users are discarded old televisions although they are in good condition.</p>
<h3>Effusion of Time</h3>
<p>Value of assets may reduce over a passage of time. For example, a patent becomes useless after expiry of the period of patent.</p>
<h3>Other Causes</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>Assets also lose their value due to weather conditions.</li>
<li>Market value of assets may fall down drastically.</li>
<li>Accidents also lead to a decrease in the value of assets.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Need for Depreciation</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>To ascertain the true profit of the year, it is desirable to charge depreciation.</p></li>
<li><p>To ascertain true value of assets, depreciation should be charged and without correct value of assets, true financial position of the company cannot be ascertained.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of withdrawal of overstated profit, it is desirable to make provisions to buy new asset and replace the old asset. Accumulated value of depreciation provides additional working capital.</p></li>
<li><p>Depreciation help us to ascertain uniform profit in each accounting year.</p></li>
<li><p>Depreciation is also useful to gain advantage o tax benefits.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Basis of Depreciation</h3>
<p>The important factors related to the depreciation chargeable are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Cost of Asset or Value of Asset</li>
<li>Estimated life of an asset</li>
<li>Scrap value of asset</li>
<li>Addition and extension in asset along with date</li>
<li>Provision of Companies Act and Income Tax Act for providing depreciation</li>
<li>Working hours of an asset</li>
<li>Working conditions of organization and handling skill of operator</li>
<li>Major repairing that increases the life of an asset</li>
<li>Chances of obsolescence of an asset</li>
</ul>
<h2>Depreciation Methods</h2>
<p>Following are the methods of depreciation &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Straight line method</li>
<li>Written down value method</li>
<li>Annuity method</li>
<li>Insurance policy method</li>
<li>Machine hour rate method</li>
<li>Depletion method</li>
<li>Revaluation method</li>
<li>Depreciation fund method</li>
<li>Mileage method</li>
<li>Production unit method</li>
<li>Global method</li>
<li>Accelerated Method</li>
<li>Double-declining Method</li>
<li>Year’s digit method</li>
</ul>
<p>Depreciation may be charged by applying any of the above methods. We will discuss a few important methods &minus;</p>
<h3>Straight Line Method</h3>
<p>Under this method, fixed amount of depreciation is charged every year. The formula to determine the amount of depreciation is as follows;</p>
<p>$$Depreciation= \frac{Cost of Assest - Scrap Value}{Estimated \:Life \:of \:an \:Assest}$$</p>
<h3>Written Down Value Method</h3>
<p>It is also called the Diminishing Balance or the Reducing Balance Method. Under this method, a fixed percentage of depreciation is charged on written down value of asset. Written down value of asset means  (Cost of asset – depreciation).</p>
<h3>Auditor’s Duty Regarding Depreciation</h3>
<p>The Auditor cannot be held responsible for estimating the working life of an asset; it is the job of an expert valuer.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A company can adopt different methods for different type of assets provided that the methods are adopted consistently over the years.</p></li>
<li><p>If a company opts to choose new depreciation methods, then depreciation should be recalculated applying new methods from the date on which the asset is put to use for the first time. The difference of amount of depreciation as charged with old rate and the amount calculated from new rate should be debited to profit and loss account in case of loss and difference should be credited to general reserve in case of profit.</p></li>
<li><p>According to Schedule II of the Companies Act, if asset is sold or discarded during the year, depreciation will be charged on pro-rata basis up to date of sale or discard. Similarly, depreciation will be charged on pro-rata basis, in case of addition to fixed asset.</p></li>
<li><p>Account must disclose method of depreciation.</p></li>
<li><p>Depreciation must be according to provisions of Companies Act and Income Tax Act.</p></li>
<li><p>If depreciation is charged more than prescribed rate, Auditor should examine whether it is based on some professional and technical advice.</p></li>
<li><p>Depreciation should be charged on revalued amount, if there is revaluation of assets.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>What is Provision?</h2>
<blockquote><p>Provisions means “any amount written off or retained by way of providing depreciation, or diminution in the value of assets or for providing any known liability of which the amount cannot be determined with substantial accuracy.” -</p> 
<p style="text-align:right"><b><i>The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India</i></p></b></blockquote>
<p>Debiting Profit and Loss account, provisions are created and shown either by deduction on the assets side or on the liabilities side under relevant subheads in the balance sheet.</p>
<p>Provision for bad and doubtful debts, provisions for repair &amp; renewals, provision for discounts and depreciation are the most common examples of provision.</p>
<h2>What are Reserves?</h2>
<p>Reserve is an appropriation of profit and on the other hand, provision is a charge against profit. Reserves are not meant to meet out contingencies or liabilities of business. Reserve increases working capital of a company to strengthen the financial position. There are two types of reserves &minus;</p>
<h3>Capital Reserve</h3>
<p>Capital reserve is not readily available for distribution as dividends among the shareholders of the company and it is created only out of capital profit of the company; this works like premium on issue of shares or debentures and Profit prior to incorporation.</p>
<h3>Revenue  Reserve</h3>
<p>Revenue reserves are readily available for distribution of profit as dividend to the shareholders of the company. Some of the examples of revenue reserves are - general reserve, staff welfare fund, dividend equalization reserve, debenture redemption reserve, contingency reserve, and investment fluctuation reserves.</p>
<h3>Auditor’s Duty Regarding Capital Reserves</h3>

In this case, to create secret reserve assets are shown at lower cost or liabilities at higher value; following examples will help you understand how this is done &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">

<li><p>Only Banking Company, Insurance Company and Electricity companies are allowed to create secret reserve.</p></li>
<li><p>In some cases where the creation of secret reserves is allowed under the Companies Act, the Auditor should examine the necessity of creating such a reserve. If the Auditor is satisfied he need not to qualify his report.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>General and specific Reserves</h3>
<p>Specific reserves are created and utilized for the purpose only for which they are created like dividend equalization reserve and debenture redemption reserve.</p>
<p>General reserves are created for any future contingency or to utilize at the time of expansion of business. The purpose behind the creation of general reserve is to strengthen the financial position of the company and to increase the working capital.</p>
<h3>Auditor’s Duty Regarding General Reserves</h3>
<p>There is no liability on the Auditor’s part to report on the creation, adequacy or inadequacy of such reserve. He may advice to the management towards the long term interests of the company.</p>
<h3>Auditor’s Duty Regarding Specific Reserves</h3>

<h3>Sinking Fund</h3>
<p>Sinking funds are of great help when it comes to repayment of liabilities or replacement of fixed assets, for this some amount is charged or appropriated from profit and loss account every year and invested in any outside securities. Without any extra ordinary burden, replacement of asset may be done in a systematic manner or pay any known liability on maturity of sinking fund.</p>
<h3>Auditor’s Duty Regarding Sinking Fund</h3>

<h1>Auditing - Capital and Revenue</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss the Auditing of Capital and Revenue.</p>
<p>It is essential to distinguish revenue expenses and capital expenditure to prepare correct financial statements. The absence of these will lead to misleading results where no one can conclude anything. As per this principle, revenue item should be posted in Trading and Profit &amp; Loss account and capital item should be posted in the balance sheet of any firm.</p>
<p>There is no firm rule for making distinction between capital expenditure and revenue expenses. Expenses may be of capital nature and capital expenditure may be of revenue nature. Allocation can be done only after knowing all the facts &amp; figures. However, we have the following rules that act as guiding principles for making a distinction between capital expenditure and revenue expenses &minus;</p>
<h2>Capital Expenditure</h2>
<p>Consider the following points to decide the nature of capital expenditure &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The expenditure, the benefit of which cannot be consumed or utilized in the same accounting period should be treated as capital expenditure.</p></li>

<li><p>Capital addition to any fixed assets which increases the life or efficiency of those assets; for example, additional expenses made on a building.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Revenue Expenditure</h2>
<p>The benefit of which is consumed in the same accounting year in which those are incurred comes under the category of revenue expenditure. Following are a few examples of revenue expenditure &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">

</ul>
<h2>How to Allocate Revenue or Capital?</h2>
<p>An item can be classified and allocated as revenue or capital on the basis of principles discussed above. Allocation requires proper care and attention otherwise there will be misleading financial results. Complete situation and facts are important before any allocation. Treating revenue expense as capital expenditure will increase profit and treating capital expenditure as revenue expense will reduce the profit.</p>
<p>Treatment for same nature of expenses can be different at two different point of time; for example, inward freight, insurance, wages and brokerage are of revenue nature in ordinary course of business but the same are treated as capital expenditure when they are incurred to purchase or development of any assets.</p>
<p>Following points can be considered to decide the nature of expenses &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Whether expenses are incurred to purchase or development of an asset.</p></li>
<li><p>Is it for an addition or improvement to fixed asset?</p></li>
<li><p>Whether it increases the revenue earning capacity.</p></li>
<li><p>Whether expenditure is towards raising of the capital sum.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If answer is in the affirmative, then expenditure is of capital nature otherwise of revenue nature.</p>
<h2>Revenue Expenses Which are Treated as Capital Expenditure</h2>
<p>Let us now discuss in brief the revenue expenses which are treated as capital expenditure.</p>
<p>Following is a list of expenses which come under revenue expenditure but should be treated as capital expenditure &minus;</p>

<li><p><b>Wages</b> &minus; If paid to build up assets or for erection and installation of Plant and Machinery.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Deferred Revenue Expenditure</h2>
<p>Some non-recurring and special nature of expenditure for which heavy amount is incurred and the benefits for the same spreads to upcoming years, such expenditure is to be treated as capital expenditure and will show as assets of the firm. Part of the expenditure should be debited to Profit & Loss account every year. For example, if heavy amount is paid for the advertisement of a product, the benefit of which are expected four years down the line, then it should be debited as 1/4 of the part in Profit &amp; Loss account as revenue expenses and balance 3/4 will be shown as assets in Balance Sheet.</p>
