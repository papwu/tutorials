<h1>Snowboarding - Overview</h1>
<p>Snowboarding is one of the popular Winter sports all over the world. In this sport, a player rides on a snow covered slope with the help of a specially designed snowboard. Snowboarding also constitutes of different kinds of styles and tricks. It’s been a part of Winter Olympics since 1998.</p>
<p>In this sport, players perform one by one based on the category and style of the sport. Boarding tricks and surfaces vary from type to type. In all types, the score awarded on the basis of degree of difficulty, efficiency in performing the skills, and creativity. The player who gets the highest score is declared as the winner.</p>
<img src="/snowboarding/images/snowboard_player.jpg" alt="Snowboard Player" />
<h2>A Brief History of Snowboarding</h2>
<p>Modern snowboarding was originated in USA in the year 1965 by Sherman Poppen who invented a toy for his daughter by fastening the two skis together with a rope attached at one end for better control. Because of its increasing popularity among his daughter’s friends, he licensed the idea to Brunswick Corporation, who later on sold about a million boards over the next decade.</p>
<p>Around the 1970s, Poppen organized many snowboarding events that attracted the attention of many people around the country. National Snurfing Championship held at Muskegon State Park, Muskego was the first snowboarding championship to offer prize money. In 1979, Jake Burton Carpenter started participating in competitions with a snowboard designed by himself which was considered as the first snowboard of modern snowboarding.</p>
<p>The first World Championship halfpipe competition was held at Soda Springs, California in 1983 and in 1985, the first Snowboarding World Cup was held at Zürs, Austria. In 1990, the International Snowboard Federation (ISF) was formed to work as the international governing body of snowboarding. It was included in the Olympic Games for the first time at 1998 Winter Olympic Games in Nagano, Japan.</p>
<h2>Participating Countries</h2>
<p>Even though it has a lot of similarity with other extreme sports like skateboarding, surfing, skiing, snowboarding has got a worldwide fan base because of its unique styles and categories. Initially started in USA, it is now played all over the world both as a sport and a recreational activity. Different movies and magazines based on the sport further enhanced its popularity.</p>
<p>Some of the countries where snowboarding is very much popular are USA, Australia, Norway, France, Canada, Switzerland, Finland, New Zealand, and Chile.</p>
<h1>Snowboarding - Equipment</h1>
<p>Besides normal sport equipment, player also use different safety equipment in order to avoid injuries. The major equipment that is needed for this sport is the snowboard. Some basic details of the equipment used in this sport are as follows &minus;</p>
<h2>Snowboard</h2>
<p>Snowboards are the basic equipment for snowboarding and are used for sliding over the snow filled surface. Usually the snowboard is made of hard wood core that is sandwiched between multiple layers of fibre glass. Other elements like carbon fibre, Kevlar, aluminium are also used in the making of a modern snowboard.</p>
<img src="/snowboarding/images/snowboard.jpg" alt="Snowboard" />
<p>The nose and tail of the board are curled in upward direction in order to ensure flawless movement on even or uneven snow. There are two different ways to design the base of the board which are <b>extruded</b> and <b>sintered.</b></p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Extruded Base</b> &minus; In case of extruded base, plastic based materials are normally melted and molded in to the desired form.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Sintered Base</b> &minus; In case of sintered base, the plastic based materials are first powdered and then are molded to the desired form using heat and pressure. Snowboards with sintered bases are much faster than boards with extruded base because of its ability to absorb wax which greatly reduces the friction between the board and the surface.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Based on different variants of the sport and the surface used, different types of snowboards are used. Some of them are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Freestyle board</b> &minus; In case of freestyle snowboarding, the boards used are in mirror image of each other along the lateral axis. These boards are mostly used on surfaces like metal rails, logs, boxes, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Free ride boards</b> &minus; These boards are typically longer in length than freestyle boards. These boards are typically directional and has a pointed tip suitable to be placed along the direction of motion. These kinds of boards can be used on any surface starting from <b>backcountry riding</b>, to <b>extreme big-mountain descents</b>.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Alpine boards</b> &minus; Alpine boards or racing boards are long, narrow, and rigid in shape and similar to free ride boards They are also typically directional and are specially designed to excel in groomed slopes. The narrow shape helps the rider to perform better during the race. Mostly hard plastic boots are ridden over it.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/snowboarding/images/boards.jpg" alt="Boards" />
<h2>Snowboarding Boots</h2>
<p>The boots used in snowboarding are generally soft plastic boots except in case of alpine snowboarding, where hard plastic boots are used. The primary functionality of these boots is to pass the rider’s motion energy to the snowboard. Based on different designs, generally three types of boots are used which are <b>standard boots, step-in boots</b>, and hard boots.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Standard Boots</b> &minus; No part of the boot is connected to the board. Most of the applied pressure is achieved through the binding.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Step-in Boots</b> &minus; In these boots, metal claps are there below the boot to attach it to the step-in bindings over the board.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Hard Boots</b> &minus; The hard boots use special bindings and are mostly used in case of alpine snowboarding for better control over the board during the racing.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/snowboarding/images/snowboarding_boots.jpg" alt="Snowboarding Boots" />
<h2>Snowboard Bindings</h2>
<p>These are specially designed equipment and are attached to the snowboard. The major functionality of these bindings is to hold the boot of the rider in proper place in order to efficiently transfer the rider’s force into the motion of the board. Based on their characteristics, there are three types of bindings which are <b>strap-in, step-in</b>, and <b>hybrid</b> bindings.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Strap Bindings</b> &minus; In strap bindings, people use boots with thick flexible sole and padded uppers. These shoes are held on the board using two padded buckle straps for better grip over the shoe. These straps are tightly fitted over different parts of the shoe to distribute pressure. Normally two strap bindings are used,
but in some cases, people use three strap bindings.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Step-in Bindings</b> &minus; Step-in bindings were improvised in order to provide better control than strap binding. Here the riders use a specially designed step-in boots and place their foot over the step-in binding.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Hybrid Bindings</b> &minus; Hybrid designs are mostly used in case of freestyle and recreational riders because of the minimum risk involved with it. It is very much similar to strap-in bindings. But the foot of the rider enters the bindings through the back side then flipped up and tightened with a clamp to give a proper grip to
the rider.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/snowboarding/images/bindings.jpg" alt="Bindings" />
<h1>Snowboarding - Playing Environment</h1>
<p>Depending on the type of snowboarding, different types of surfaces are used. In case of freestyle and jibbing, mostly skateparks and halfpipe surfaces are used. In case of alpine snowboarding, a special designed race course is created. A brief idea about these surface areas is as follows &minus;</p>
<h2>Freestyle Snowboarding</h2>
<p>In case of freestyle snowboarding, the snowboarders mostly use skate parks as the playing environment. The basic surfaces used are metal rails, logs, boxes, stairs etc. There are no certain specifications about the surfaces in case of jibbing and free style snowboarding.</p>
<img src="/snowboarding/images/freestyle_snowboarding.jpg" alt="Freestyle Snowboarding" />
<h2>Halfpipe Snowboarding</h2>
<p>For halfpipe snowboarding, players use a halfpipe surface which looks like the bottom half of a pipe with two sides covered with walls and the middle sloppy ramp surface filled with snow for the ride. The walls on both side must have a height between 8-23 feet.</p>
<p>In case of skateboarding, the halfpipe surface used is basically made of wood or cement, here the surface will be completely made of snow or partially with a coating of snow over the basic surface.</p>
<h2>Alpine Snowboarding</h2>
<p>In case of alpine snowboarding, the playing environment used is called <b>piste</b> and it comprises of a landscape above 1200 m and is covered with snow. The landscape is basically a slope structured area. For the race, different paths are drawn over the landscape with turns and slopes over the course.</p>
<img src="/snowboarding/images/alpine_snowboarding.jpg" alt="Alpine Snowboarding" />
<p>Usually the <b>pistes</b> have groomed and symmetric surfaces without any unevenness which is achieved by running a snowcat over the <b>piste</b>. Based on the degree of difficulty in riding over these slope surfaces, different colours are used. Usually in all regions, green is used to denote the easiest slopes whereas black colour is used for the expert level slopes.</p>
<h1>How to Play Snowboarding?</h1>
<p>Since its invention, Snowboarding has gone through a lot of changes and improvisations. Based on the modern snowboarding, different variants have been invented which are <b>Jibbing, Alpine, Freestyle, Snowboard Racing</b> where all of these types differ from each other in case of equipment and the bases used as the snowboarding surface. These snowboarding styles are described below.</p>
<h2>Jibbing</h2>
<p>Jibbing is also known as <b>Cruising</b> in which the rider rides on nonstandard surfaces and performs different tricks. In case of jibbing, the players mostly ride and slide above surfaces that are mostly other than snow. These surfaces can be boxes, metal rails, logs, benches, rocks etc. Basically the rider has to ride on anything that comes in his/her way. It is mostly performed in skate parks.</p>
<img src="/snowboarding/images/jibbing.jpg" alt="Jibbing" />
<h2>Freestyle Snowboarding</h2>
<p>In case of freestyle snowboarding, the more importance is given to the tricks performed rather than the surfaces. The players have to ride on a snowboard on any of the surfaces that comes along the way which can be a log, rock, metal rails, or boxes.</p>
<img src="/snowboarding/images/freestyle.jpg" alt="Freestyle" />
<p>These surfaces can be either manmade or natural. Freestyle snowboarding can be performed in a skate park or in natural environment. There are different types of freestyle snowboarding based on the surfaces used.</p>
<h2>Halfpipe Snowboarding</h2>
<p>Halfpipe snowboarding is one of the most popular formats of snowboarding. Here the surface used has the shape of a half pipe. It is a semi-circular surface with two sides covered with walls and the middle sloppy ramp surface is filled with snow for the ride.</p>
<img src="/snowboarding/images/halfpipe_snowboarding.jpg" alt="Halfpipe snowboarding" />
<p>The players start at one edge of the slope, slide down to and from different sides perform different tricks while moving from one side to another and being in the air. The height of the walls of the half pipe lies between 8 feet to 23 feet.</p>
<h2>Slopestyle Snowboarding</h2>
<p>In case of slope style snowboarding, the surface used is a terrain park. Here, the terrains are filled with different manmade surfaces which can be boxes, logs, metal rails, jibs etc. Here the basis of scoring is the surface chosen and efficiency of the tricks performed.</p>
<img src="/snowboarding/images/slopestyle_snowboarding.jpg" alt="Slopestyle Snowboarding" />
<p>In order to win the slope style competition, the player not only has to go for hardest surfaces, he/she must perform all the tricks smoothly on the chosen surface. Slope style snowboarding competitions are mostly held at specially built surfaces in mountain areas.</p>
<h2>Alpine Snowboarding</h2>
<p>In case of alpine snowboarding, the sport takes place in a hard packed snowed surface. Also called as carving, here the players have to mostly focus on carving blinked turns similar to surfing and skiing. Here the players wear hard plastic boots and then place the board below their feet with the front toe being in line with the snowboard tip.</p>
<img src="/snowboarding/images/alpine.jpg" alt="Alpine" />
<p>The snowboard used in alpine snowboarding is narrower in comparison to the snowboards of other variants. Here the players tilt the snowboard high on the edge while leaning in turns till his/her hand touches the snow, which is known as carving. Carving is helpful in maintaining the speed as well as proper balance in case of alpine. Speed is a major plus in this variant and there is very less or zero jumping throughout the race.</p>
<h2>Snowboard Racing</h2>
<p>In case of freestyle and alpine, the scoring is based on the efficiency and smoothness of the tricks performed by the rider. In case of snowboard racing, players race against each other on a narrow snow filled surface having turns. The players perform different tricks such as jumps, berms, roller, steep etc. in order to stay in control while racing. One of the major forms of snowboard racing is called snowboard cross.</p>
<p>In case of snowboard cross competition, there are two rounds which are time trial round and knock out round. In case of knock out round, a certain number of players qualify for the next round while other players are eliminated from the race. Once the knock down round is over, it is followed by the time trial round where players either ride alone on a singular track or parallel adjacent tracks. In this round, the player to complete the race in fastest time is declared winner.</p>
