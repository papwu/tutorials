<h1>Hockey - Overview</h1>
<p>Hockey is normally played on grass field or turf field or an indoor stadium. Hockey is predominantly a stick and ball game (stick made of wood). Hockey is also the National Game of India.</p>
<img src="/hockey/images/national_game_hockey.jpg" alt="National Game Hockey" />
<p>The objective of this game is to pass the ball with a bat to the goal of opposite players’ court. Other players will be trying to take the ball away and make their goal. The players in the team will be assigned positions for which the duties will be defined earlier. The task of each player in the team is to get the ball in the opponent’s goal point. All the players should be co-operative in scoring more goals.</p>
<h2>Team Size</h2>
<p>The Hockey is either played girls against girls or boys against boys. The team consists of 11 members and each player is assigned with a particular position and task. Like most games, team work is the basic element of winning and the entire team’s contribution is crucial for success.</p>
<p>The 11 players consist of Goalkeepers, Defenders and Strikers. Individual player has got their tasks to work on in the game. The hockey squad will be having a total of 16 players as the game allows rolling substitutions under necessary conditions. The rest 5 players will be a backup most of the time.</p>
<h2>History of Hockey</h2>
<p>Hockey, as a sport of stick and ball, dates back to middle-age. Some of the carvings of this sport were found in Ireland and Greece in 1200 and 600 BC respectively. It is assumed that the sport existed some 4000 years ago. However, hockey took its actual form with government organization to recognize the sport. Hence, specific rules of the game were introduced in early 19<sup>th</sup> century. Countries like England, Germany, Argentina, Spain, India, Malaysia, and Pakistan have international teams and take part in all the annual events organized by International Hockey Federation (FIH) formed in 1924.</p>
<h2>Participating Countries</h2>
<p>As Hockey was literally originated in England, Scotland and Netherlands, it was encouraged by various other countries as they participated in the game. The International Hockey Federation governs the sport all over the globe. Men and women represent in competitions including Olympics Games, Champions Trophy, World League and Junior World Cup with many countries which run masters’, senior and junior club competitions. This body is responsible for rules development for the game.</p>
<p>Most countries take part in this game. There are more than 50 countries that participate in hockey. But to consider the countries that are termed as the <b>Big Eight</b> include Canada, Sweden, USA, Russia, Finland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Switzerland. As Canada invented the game, they are the best in it. More than 60% of National Hockey League players are from Canada. It’s a right that if you are born in Canada, you are born for Hockey.</p>
<p>The top twenty hockey playing countries are Canada, Sweden, United States of America, Russia, Finland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Switzerland, Germany, Latvia, India, China, North Korea, United Kingdom, Belarus, Denmark, Mongolia, Japan, South Korea and Indonesia. India was ranked as the eleventh country in Hockey playing.</p>
<h1>Hockey - Playing Environment</h1>
<h2>Ground Design</h2>
<p>Hockey is a speed demanding game. It demands speed from its players and also from its playing surface. No other sport beats the surface like hockey does and hence, the surface should be incredibly durable handling the wear and tear of hockey sport. The surface has to be maintained to enable a top-level game to the players. The base design is to be maintained in any of the two designs namely <b>Diagonal fall design</b> and <b>Crown design</b>.</p>
<p>The diagonal fall design directs all the surface water to a collection pit at the corner. Whereas, the crown design flows the surface water to all the four corners allowing them to collect there like the crown in the center. It allows the water to collect at a corner or all the four corners for cleaning and slightly tilting the ground. This is the base design of the ground and is followed in all the ground designs.</p>
<p>After the base is finished, In-situ shock pad is to be installed over the base. It consists of black SBR granules and polyurethane binder. This is mixed on site and laid to specified depth. This gives a firm hold of the ground and the strength. The hardness below the ground makes it sustainable from the beatings of the hockey bat during the play. As per the requirement of the FIH (Federation International Hockey) the ground is made to shock absorbent.</p>
<img src="/hockey/images/ground_design.jpg" alt="Ground Design" />
<p>After the base is designed, there goes Grass Installation Process. Joining Tapes are being located and fixed. For ‘wet’ field installation, glue is stripped between the rolls. The grass edges are being folded back and 2-pack PU adhesive is used to joining tape. Lay back grass edges and the seaming is to be matched.</p>
<h2>Dimensions</h2>
<p>Earlier, the game was played on a natural turf or grass field. But now-a-days it is played on artificial turfs. In the 1970’s, the transition into artificial turfs came into existence and its being made mandatory since 1976. All the markings, lines, and goals are specified by the International Hockey Federation in the <b>Rules of Hockey</b>. The foul game is played in a 23 meter area.</p>
<p>Standard pitch measurements are given as 91.4 by 55.0 meters i.e., 100 yards by 60 yards. The total area of the field is 5027 square meters (1.24 acres). The hockey pitch is shaped in rectangular manner. The long perimeter side is named as <b>side lines</b> and the short perimeter edges are named as <b>back lines</b>. The portion between goal posts is known as <b>Goal Lines</b>. All lines are colored white with 75mm wide. At all the corners of the pitch, a flag of max 300 mm square is attached to a post of height 1.20 to 1.50 meters.</p>
<img src="/hockey/images/dimensions.jpg" alt="Dimensions " />
<p>The inner edge of the goal post must be equal to 3.66meters (4yards) apart. The lower edge of the crossbar should be 2.14 meters height above the ground. The goalposts and crossbar should be white and rectangular and should be 50mm wide and 50 to 75mm deep. The goal post should be 460mm or 18 inches wide. There is a net to stop the ball at the posts and crossbar.</p>
<p>With the specified dimensions, the design of the hockey field is finished. These are the standard dimensions that are given by the International Hockey Federation in the rules of hockey. During the first few games held, the dimensions vary from the present calculations. Then in 1987, the lengths were changed to the present dimensions and they were now followed in every game.</p>
<h1>Hockey - Equipment</h1>
<p>Hockey stick and ball are the most important equipment without which the sport cannot be played. There are many other equipment like shin guard, helmet, glove, shoes, etc., that a hockey player uses during the match.</p>
<p>The following are the equipment used in the hockey game by the goalie and the players.</p>
<p><b>Hockey Stick</b> &minus; It is a wooden stick with length varying from 26’’ to 38.5’’ depending on height of the player. The bat has a hooked shape at the head. There are mostly four types of variations namely <b>shorti</b>, <b>midi</b>, <b>maxi</b> and the <b>J Hook</b> depending on the efficiency of the player holding the ball.</p>
<img src="/hockey/images/equipment.jpg" alt="Equipment" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>The shorti type</b> is used by players, who take an extreme control over the ball to increase the manoeuvrability. Generally, the players at the mid field position use this type of bat in the game.</p></li>
<li><p><b>The midi type</b> is used by the players who hit the ball more often and need to be strong on the reverse side. Strikers use midi predominantly.</p></li>
<li><p><b>The maxi type</b> is used by the players who act as defenders or attackers. This bat is similar to the midi type but the surface area is being increased. For stopping the ball, its strength allows it to be much more efficient in doing that.</p></li>
<li><p><b>The J Hook type</b> has a much larger surface area. However, it doesn’t possess the efficiency of the midi type in striking the ball. But, for stopping the ball it has an increased thickness. This head type is preferred by the defenders.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Ball</b> &minus; The hockey ball is a plastic spherical shaped material made of cork core usually white colored. The color varies based on the color of the ground on which the game is played. The circumference of the ball is generally 224 to 235mm. It weighs around 156 to 163gms. To reduce aquaplaning, the ball is covered with indentations so that on wet grounds the inconsistent ball speed cannot occur.</p>
<p><b>Shin guards</b> &minus; It is worn in front of a player’s shin for protection from injury.</p>
<p><b>Mouth guards</b> &minus; It is to protect the mouth and teeth during the game while playing.</p>
<p><b>Helmet and throat protector</b> &minus; These equipment are used to protect head and throat from getting injured.</p>
<p><b>Cleats (Shoes)</b> &minus; There are special types of shoes which enhance the free walk and run over the ground.</p>
<p><b>Goggles, Gloves, Head bands</b> &minus; Goggles and gloves are used by the goalies whereas; head bands are used by the players except the goal keepers.</p>
<p><b>Goalie sticks and heads</b> &minus; For hitting the ball and striking it, the goal keepers use a different type of bat.</p>
<p><b>Face Mask</b> &minus; It is one of the latest equipment in hockey. It exposes only the eyes and covers rest of the face. Again, this is also made of fiber. It has elastic band or belt to fit firmly.</p>
<p><b>Body Pad or Chest Protector</b> &minus; The body pad covers the ribs from getting hurt. This is worn inside the uniform.</p>
<p><b>Pads</b> &minus; The pads are worn to protect knees and lower part of limbs.</p>
<p><b>Kicker</b> &minus; Kicker is a unique show used by goalkeepers. They are strong enough to protect the toes when goalkeeper tries to kick or block the ball to prevent goal.</p>
<p>These are the equipment used for playing hockey and most of the equipment are used by the goalkeepers. The goalkeeper is given much protection in comparison to other players as they have to move continuously and weight of the equipment may slow down their movement.</p>
<h1>Hockey - Terms</h1>

<h1>How to Play Hockey?</h1>
<p>Hockey is played outdoors in rectangular field. Two teams of 11 players each play the game. One of them wears helmet, pads, and stands in-front of goal with a J-shaped hockey stick. The sport requires lot of stamina stand athleticism as one has to run along with ball and stick to score the goal.</p>
<h2>Getting Ready</h2>
<p>The game begins with a toss where both captains are present. One of them calls it correctly and gets the choice to pass first or choose a particular end of the field; just like the toss in other games.</p>
<p>The game is played for 75 minutes that includes a five minute half-time interval. Both sessions are played for 35 minutes each. The time is paused in between the game for substitutions, treatment for injury, etc., and then resumes.</p>
<img src="/hockey/images/getting_ready.jpg" alt="Getting Ready" />
<h2>Quick Glimpse of the Game</h2>
<p>The hockey players take their respective positions on the field. One of the teams starts the game with a centre pass and continues to attack opponent to score a goal. The player taking centre pass can only stand in the other half of field while his team members should stand within their half of defending goal. The player taking centre pass is permitted to hit the ball in any direction.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The team members keep passing the ball and look for opportunities to score the goal while the opponents tackle them and try to take control of the ball.</p></li>
<li><p>If the game is paused any moment for injury or substitution, it resumes by the player passing the ball from nearest spot of stoppage of play. This is called <b>bully</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>A player from each team stands close to the ball with defending goals on their right to take a bully. Both players tap faces of their sticks and one of the players is allowed to hit the ball.</p></li>
<li><p>A free-hit situation arises when a player hits the ball outside the sideline or baseline. Free-hit is taken by a defender by placing the ball 15 meters in line to the centre of goal.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/hockey/images/free_hit.jpg" alt="Free-hit" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>If a ball is hit outside the sideline by a player then defender of the opponent team will take free hit by placing the ball in line within 15 meters from where the ball has crossed.</p></li>
<li><p>If the ball is hit outside the back line by a player then defender of opponent team will take free hit by placing the ball within 15 meters from centre of goal.</p></li>
<li><p>If the ball is hit outside the back line by opponent player then a penalty corner is awarded to the team attacking the goal. The ball is placed in line to back line and to right of goal post at a distance of 15 meters.</p></li>
<li><p>If the ball is hit outside the back line by goal keeper of opponent team then a corner is awarded to attacking team. The ball is then placed in line to 23 meters line and hit by player of attacking team.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Duration of a Match</h2>
<p>A regular hockey match takes place for 70 minutes consisting two halves each of 35 minutes. Also, sometimes matches end in draw. But the official matches should have a winner unlike other matches. If in any case, the game is a tie then extra time is given. If there is tie again then penalty flick competition decides the winner of the match.</p>
<p>A player passes the ball among them to progress it towards the goal using a triangle method of passing system. This prevents the opponent to intercept the ball.</p>
<h1>Hockey - Penalties</h1>
<p>A more specific requirement of a hockey player is that he/she should be able to shoot, pass, stop, push and control the ball with their hockey stick. These skills are much impressing but without the help of other mates in the team, it is merely impossible to step towards success.</p>
<h2>No Feet</h2>
<p>The most important thing about the game is that the players are not allowed to touch the ball with feet or other parts of the body. The goalkeeper alone can use the hands for catching the ball. Goalkeeper can use any part of the body to deflect the incoming ball when defending.</p>
<h2>Scoring</h2>
<p>It is very interesting thing to learn how to score in hockey. Specific ways to win a score are penalty corner, field goal, and penalty stroke.</p>
<h3>Taking a Penalty Corner</h3>
<p>Only four players are allowed along with a goal keeper. They must be behind the baseline inside or outside the goal. The other defending players must be behind the half way line or on the line. Any number of players from the attacking team can be there to attack but most probably seven will be the attacking players. One player will be injecting the ball from baseline.</p>
<p>The presence of a stopper at the top of D depends on the set-up of the team. When the injection of the ball takes place before it re-enters D and shot at goal, it must go out of D first. For the first strike to be counted, it must be below the back board, if it is a drag or a deflection, it can end anywhere inside the goal and it can also be counted.</p>
<img src="/hockey/images/penalty_corner.jpg" alt="Penalty Corner" />
<h3>Taking a Penalty Stroke</h3>
<p>When there is an infringement inside of D, the penalty stroke is given if there was a definite goal scoring chance. It is a free shot that was taken by one attacker against one goal keeper only and from a distance of 6.4 meters straight in front of the goal. The duration of the match is stopped when there is a penalty stroke taken.</p>
<img src="/hockey/images/penalty_stroke.jpg" alt="Penalty Stroke" />
<h2>Fouls</h2>
<p>The on-field players are not allowed to control or stop the ball with feet or any other body part. A free-hit is awarded to a team if ball hits the opponent player’s body. The hockey ball is often scooped by players to pass it to their team members directly. However, the same shot is given as foul by the referee if it is played dangerously.</p>
<p>Apart from these, there are tackling fouls where players are found to be little rough with opponent players to take control of ball. The game is observed very closely by referee to declare fouls and make important decisions. The referees in the game display cards in three colors, each of which indicates the level of foul or offence committed by a player.</p>
<ul class="list">
<img class="raligned" src="/hockey/images/fouls.jpg" alt="Fouls" />
<li><p><b>Green card</b> &minus; The player may not leave the pitch (international standards say that the player may leave the pitch for two minutes), but further infractions indulge in a red or yellow card.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Yellow card</b> &minus; It is a suspension where the time is decided by the card issuing umpire. Mostly, five minutes will be the chosen time by any umpire. But, if the offense is serious the time may exceed or the player is replaced.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Red card</b> &minus; It is a permanent exclusion from the game. Here the player is banned for some time or for a few matches. The player should leave the pitch in this case.</p></li>
</ul>
