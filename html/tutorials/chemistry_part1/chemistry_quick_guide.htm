<h1>Chemistry - Matter In Our Surroundings</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Everything found in this universe is made up of some materials, scientists have named them as <b>“matter.”</b> For example, the food we eat, the air we breathe, stones, clouds, stars, plants, animals, water, dust, everything is categorized as matter.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Characteristics of Particles of Matter</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Particles of matter are very small, normally, not visible from naked eye.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/chemistry_part1/images/particles_of_matters.jpg" alt="Particles Of Matter" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Particles of matter keep moving continuously, which is known as the <b>“kinetic energy.”</b></p></li>
<li><p>Kinetic energy of particles directly depends on the temperature, as temperature increases, the speed of the movement also increases.</p></li>
<li><p>The particles of matter have attracting force; therefore, they attract each other.</p></li>
<li><p>The attracting force of the particles keeps the particles together; however, the strength of the attracting force varies from one kind of matter to another.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>States of Matter</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Matter has three following states &minus;</p></li>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p><b>Solid State</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>Liquid State</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>Gaseous State</b></p></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<img src="/chemistry_part1/images/state_of_matter.jpg" alt="States of Matter" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Let’s discuss them in brief &minus;</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Solid State</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>All the solid materials have a definite shape, distinct boundaries, and fixed volumes.</p></li>
<li><p>Most of the solid materials have negligible compressibility.</p></li>
<li><p>All the solid materials have a natural tendency to maintain their shape when subjected to outside force.</p></li>
<li><p>The solid materials can be broken under applied force, but it is very difficult to change their shape, as they are rigid.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Liquid State</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Unlike solids, liquids have no fixed shape; however, they have a fixed volume.</p></li>
<li><p>Liquids take up the shape of the container in which they are kept.</p></li>
<li><p>Liquids have the property to flow and change shape.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Gaseous State</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Matter in the form of air, which is neither solid nor liquid, is known as gas. For example, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Unlike solid, gas has not definite size and shape.</p></li>
<li><p>The gases, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG – used in cooking); compressed natural gas (CNG – used as fuel in vehicles), etc. have high compressibility; therefore, large volume of a gas can be compressed into a small cylinder and can be transported easily.</p></li>
<li><p>Gases, normally, show the property of diffusing very fast into other gases. This is the reason that we can smell (either good or bad) from the distance.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Matter Can Change its State</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Water can exist in all three states, e.g. Ice as solid; water (H2O) as liquid; and water vapor as gas. The following diagram illustrates the transformation of water in different states &minus;</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/chemistry_part1/images/different_state_of_water.jpg" alt="Different State Of Water" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The temperature, at which solid melt and transform into the liquid (at the given atmospheric pressure), is known as <b>“melting point.”</b></p></li>
<li><p>The melting point of a solid is an indication of the strength of the force of attraction between its particles.</p></li>
<li><p>The melting point of ice is 273.16 K, i.e. 0<sup>0</sup> C.</p></li>
<li><p>The process of melting (i.e. change of solid state into liquid state) is known as <b>fusion</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The amount of heat energy, which is required to change 1 kg of a solid materials into liquid materials at a given atmospheric pressure, is known as the <b>latent heat</b> of fusion.</p></li>
<li><p>The temperature at which a liquid starts boiling at the given atmospheric pressure is known as <b>“boiling point.”</b></p></li>
<li><p>The boiling point of water is 373 K i.e. 100<sup>0</sup>C.</p></li>
<li><p>A change of state of a matter directly from solid to gas without changing into liquid state (or vice versa) is known as <b>“sublimation.”</b></p></li>
<li><p>The phenomenon i.e. change of a liquid into vapors at any temperature below its boiling point is known as <b>“evaporation.”</b></p></li>
<li><p>Solid carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is stored under high pressure.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/chemistry_part1/images/solid_carbon_dioxide.jpg" alt="Solid Carbon Dioxide" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Solid CO<sub>2</sub> gets converted directly into gaseous state once the pressure decreases to 1 atmosphere.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Atmosphere</b> (atm) is a unit of measuring pressure exerted by the gas and the unit of pressure is Pascal (Pa); 1 atmosphere = 1.01 × 105 Pa.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>The Fourth State of Matter</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p><b>Plasma</b> is the state that consists of super energetic and super excited particles.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/chemistry_part1/images/plasma.jpg" alt="Plasma" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The super excited particles are found in the form of ionized gases. E.g. the fluorescent tube (which contains helium gas) and neon sign bulbs (which contain neon gas) consist of plasma.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Chemistry - Is Matter Around Us Pure</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>A pure substance is that that consists of single type of particle or particles.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/chemistry_part1/images/mixture.jpg" alt="Mixture" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Mixtures of two or more pure components without any undesirable substance are known as <b>Mixtures</b>, for example, water, minerals, soil etc.</p></li>
<li><p>A homogeneous mixture of two or more substances is known as <b>solution</b>. For example, lemonade, soda water etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Solution could be in any form such as – it could be in liquid, solid, or gaseous.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Alloys</b> are another example of mixture that contain homogeneous mixtures of metals; they cannot be separated into their components by physical methods. E.g. For example, brass is a mixture of zinc (approximately 30%) and copper (about 70%).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Significant Features of Solution</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Solution is normally a homogeneous mixture.</p></li>
<li><p>The particles of a solution are even smaller than 1 nm (10-9 meter) in diameter and hence, these are not visible from the naked eyes.</p></li>
<li><p>The path of light is not visible in a solution.</p></li>
<li><p>The dissolved particles cannot be separated from the mixture by the simple process of filtration.</p></li>
<li><p>The dissolved particles do not settle down when it left undisturbed.</p></li>
<li><p>At a given temperature, when no more solute can be dissolved in a solution, it is known as <b>‘saturated solution.’</b></p></li>
<li><p>At a given temperature, the amount of the dissolved particles present in the saturated solution, is known as <b>solubility.’</b></p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Suspension</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>A suspension is a heterogeneous mixture in which the solute particles do not dissolve, but rather remain suspended throughout the bulk of the medium, is known as <b>‘suspension.’</b></p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Significant features of Suspension</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Particles of a suspension are clearly visible from the naked eye.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/chemistry_part1/images/suspended_particles.jpg" alt="Suspended Particles" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The particles of a suspension scatter a beam of light that passes through it and likewise, its path is visible.</p></li>
<li><p>The salute particles can be separated from the mixture by the simple process of filtration.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Colloid</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>A heterogeneous mixture is known as <b>‘colloid.’</b> E.g. mist, fog, smoke, face cream, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="/chemistry_part1/images/colloid.jpg" alt="Colloid" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The size of colloid particles is too small to see from the naked eye.</p></li>
<li><p>Colloid particles are big enough to scatter a beam of light passing through it and make the path visible.</p></li>
<li><p>Colloid particles cannot be separated from the mixture by the simple process of filtration.</p></li>
<li><p>The special filtration technique i.e. <b>centrifugation,</b> can be used to separate the colloidal particles.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Chromatography</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The process of separation of components of a mixture is called as <b>chromatography</b>; normally it is used for the color separation.</p></li>
<li><p>Chromatography technique is used for separation of those solutes that dissolve in the same solvent.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Distillation</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The process of purifying a liquid by heating and cooling means is known as distillation.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Crystallization</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The process that separates a pure solid in the form of its crystals from a solution is known as <b>‘crystallization.’</b></p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Elements</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>In 1661, Robert Boyle was the first scientist who used the term <b>element;</b> Antoine Laurent Lavoisier, a French chemist, was the first who experimentally define the term element.</p></li>
<li><p>Element is as a basic form of matter that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by a chemical reaction.</p></li>
<li><p>Elements normally can be categorized as <b>metals, non-metals,</b> and <b>metalloids</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Metal</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>A solid material, which typically is hard, ductile, malleable, shiny, and fusible with good electrical and thermal conductivity, is known as <b>metal</b>. E.g. gold, silver, copper, aluminum, etc.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Acid or Base in a Water Solution</h3>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The hydrogen ions in HCl are produced because of the presence of water. Secondly, the separation of H<sup>+</sup> ion from the HCl molecules cannot be done in the absence of water. The chemical formula is illustrated below</p>

<h2>pH Scale</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>A scale, used in measuring the hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, is known as <b>pH scale</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <b>‘p’</b> in pH stands for <b>‘potenz’,</b> it is a German term, which means <b>‘power’.</b></p></li>
<li><p>pH value is taken simply as a number, which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution. So, if the concentration of hydronium ion is higher, then the value of pH would be lower.</p></li>
<li><p>The value of pH scale ranges between <b>‘0’</b> and <b>’14;’</b> so, if pH value is measured ‘0,’ it means – it is very <b>acidic</b> and if it is 14, then it means – it very <b>alkaline</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The neutral value of pH scale is <b>‘7’.</b></p></li>
<li><p>On a pH scale, values less than 7 represent an acidic solution and values greater than 7 represent a basic solution.</p></li>

<li><p>The stomach of a human body produces hydrochloric acid that helps in the digestion of food; surprisingly, it does not harm the stomach anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>However, when the stomach produces too much acid (known as indigestion), it causes pain and irritation. To get relief from this pain, doctors suggest the use of bases known as antacids.</p></li>
<li><p>These antacids neutralize and control the increased amount of acid.</p></li>
<li><p>The teeth, which are made up of calcium phosphate, is the hardest substance in the body. However, when the pH in the mouth decreases (below 5.5), it corrodes the teeth.</p></li>
<li><p>The salt, normally, is formed by the combination of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide solution; and, the combination is known as sodium chloride.</p></li>
<li><p>When the pH value of rain water is measured as less than 5.6, it is known as <b>acid rain</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>When acid rain flows into the rivers, then it also lowers the pH of the river water</p></li>
<li><p>The acidic river water is threat for the survival of aquatic life.</p></li>

<h2>Facts of Metals and Non-metals</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>All metals exist in the solid form at room temperature, except mercury.</p></li>
<li><p>Gallium and caesium have very low melting points; these two metals get melt even on palm.</p></li>
<li><p>Iodine is a non-metal, but it is lustrous (lustrous is the property of metal).</p></li>
<li><p>Carbon is a non-metal that can exist in different forms. Each form is called an allotrope.</p></li>
<li><p>Diamond is an allotrope of carbon and it is the hardest natural substance known.</p></li>
<li><p>The melting and boiling point of diamond is very high.</p></li>
<li><p>Graphite is also allotrope of carbon; it is a conductor of electricity.</p></li>
<li><p>Alkali metals, such as lithium, potassium, sodium, are the examples of soft metals, as they can be cut with a knife.</p></li>
<li><p>Nearly all metals when combined with oxygen, it forms metal oxides.</p></li>
<li><p>Different metals have different frequency of reaction; some react slow, but some react very fast. E.g. potassium and sodium are very reactive and they catch fire only if kept in the open.</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore, potassium and sodium are kept immersed in kerosene oil so that they cannot catch fire.</p></li>
<li><p>However, among all metals, sodium (most likely), is the most reactive metal.</p></li>
<li><p>Anodizing is a process of forming a thick protective oxide layer of aluminum and it protects from corrosion.</p></li>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Carbon plays very important roles for all living beings.</p></li>
<li><p>The amount of carbon in the earth’s crust is merely 0.02%, which is available in the form of minerals such as carbonates, hydrogen-carbonates, coal, and petroleum.</p></li>

<h1>Periodic Classification Of Elements</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>There are about 115 elements have been known to us till today.</p></li>
<li><p>Based on their properties, all the elements are arranged in order, known as periodic table.</p></li>
<li><p>Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner, a German scientist, first attempted to arrange the elements in 1817.</p></li>
<li><p>John Newlands, an English scientist, also attempted to arrange the then known elements (in 1866).</p></li>
<li><p>John Newlands had followed the order of increasing atomic masses to arrange the elements.</p></li>
<li><p>Newlands started with the element having the lowest atomic mass (such as hydrogen) and ended at thorium, which was the 56th element (at his time).</p></li>
</ul>
<img  src="/chemistry_part1/images/john_newland.jpg" alt="John Newland" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Newlands’ arrangement of elements is known as “Law of Octaves,” as in his arrangement every eight element had the properties similar to that of the first. E.g. the properties of lithium and sodium were found to be the same.</p></li>

<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Newlands also compared it with the octaves that found in music (see the table given above).</p></li>
<li><p>In the Indian music, the seven musical notes are – <i>sa, re, ga, ma, pa, da, ni;</i> however, in the west, the musical notes are – <i>do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti.</i></p></li>
<li><p>Further, in order to fit some elements into his Table, Newlands put two elements in the same cell (see the table given above – cobalt &amp; nickel kept in same cell), but this technique did not work, as they have different properties.</p></li>
<li><p>However, the law of octave had limitation, as was applicable up to calcium only; and, after calcium every eighth element had not the properties similar to that of the first.</p></li>

<h2>Mendeléev’s Periodic Table</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeléev, a Russian chemist, who successfully attempted to arrange the elements.</p></li>
<li><p>Mendeléev arranged the elements based on their (elements) fundamental property, the atomic mass, as well as on the similarity of chemical properties.</p></li>
<li><p>During the Mendeleev’s time, only 63 elements were known.</p></li>
<li><p>Mendeléev’s Periodic Table consists of vertical columns known as <b>‘groups’</b> and horizontal rows known as <b>‘periods.’</b></p></li>
</ul>
<img  src="/chemistry_part1/images/mendeleev.jpg" alt="Mendeleev" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Mendeléev’s Periodic Law states that</p>
<p><i>‘The properties of elements are the periodic function of their atomic masses’.</i></p></li>
<li><p>Mendeléev arranged the sequence in inverted fashion so that elements with similar properties could be grouped together.</p></li>
<li><p>Mendeléev left space for some elements, which were not discovered at that time; he boldly predicted about the existence of future elements.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the biggest limitation of Mendeléev’s Periodic formula is - no fixed position has been assigned to hydrogen in the Periodic Table.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Modern Periodic Table</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>In 1913, Henry Moseley, an English physicist discovered that the atomic number of an element is a more fundamental property in comparison to its atomic mass.</p></li>
<li><p>Based on Moseley’s discovery, Mendeléev’s Periodic Law was modified and atomic number was adopted as the basis of Modern Periodic Table.</p></li>
<li><p>The Modern Periodic Law states &minus;</p>
<p><i>‘Properties of elements are a periodic function of their atomic number.’</i></p></li>
<li><p><b>18</b> vertical columns known as ‘<b>groups</b>’ and <b>7</b> horizontal rows known as ‘periods’ are defined in the Modern Periodic Table.</p></li>
<li><p>In Modern Periodic Table, the elements are arranged in such a way that it shows periodicity of properties such as atomic size, valency, or combining capacity and metallic and non-metallic characteristics (of elements).</p></li>
<li><p>In Modern Periodic Table, the metallic character decreases across a period and increases down the group.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, non-metals are electronegative, as they tend to form bonds by gaining electrons.</p></li>
<li><p>In Modern Periodic Table, the non-metals are placed on the right-hand side (from the top).</p></li>

<li><p>Plastic is also a sort of polymer like the synthetic fiber.</p></li>
<li><p>Polythene (Poly + ethene) is a common example of a plastic.</p></li>
<li><p>There are some plastics, which when molded once, cannot be softened by heating; therefore, these are known as thermosetting plastics. E.g. Bakelite and melamine.</p></li>
<li><p>Bakelite is a poor conductor of heat and electricity; therefore, it is used in making electrical switches, handles of various utensils, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Melamine resists fire and can tolerate heat better than other plastics; therefore, it is used for making floor tiles, kitchenware, and fabrics.</p></li>
<li><p>A material, which gets decomposed through the natural processes, e.g. action by bacteria, is known as biodegradable.</p></li>
<li><p>A material, which cannot be easily decomposed by natural processes, is known as non-biodegradable.</p></li>

<h1>Chemistry - Combustion and Flame</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>A chemical process in which a substance reacts with oxygen and give off heat is known as <b>combustion</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The substance that undergoes combustion is called as <b>combustible</b> or <b>fuel</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The fuel can be in the form of solid, liquid, or gas.</p></li>
<li><p>During the combustion, light is also given off either in the form of a <b>flame</b> or as a <b>glow</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<img  src="/chemistry_part1/images/flame_glow.jpg" alt="Flame, Glow" />
<ul class="list examslist">

<li><p>There are three different zones of a flame dark zone, luminous zone and non-luminous zone.</p></li>
</ul>
<img  src="/chemistry_part1/images/different_zone_of_flame.jpg" alt="Different Zone of Flame" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Different substances catch fire at different temperatures.</p></li>
<li><p>The lowest temperature at which a substance catches fire is known as its <b>ignition temperature</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>A match contains antimony trisulphide and potassium chlorate.</p></li>
<li><p>The rubbing surface of match contains powdered glass and a little red phosphorus.</p></li>
<li><p>Red phosphorus is much less dangerous.</p></li>
<li><p>When the match stick is struck against the rubbing surface, some red phosphorus gets converted into white phosphorus; the process immediately reacts with potassium chlorate present in the matchstick head and produce enough heat to ignite antimony trisulphide; likewise, combustion starts.</p></li>
<li><p>The substances, which have very low ignition temperature and can easily catch fire with a flame, are known as <b>inflammable substances</b>. E. g. petrol, alcohol, Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG), etc.</p></li>
