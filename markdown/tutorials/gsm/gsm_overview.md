   * GSM stands for **G**lobal **S**ystem for **M**obile Communication. It is a digital cellular technology used for transmitting mobile voice and data services.
   * The concept of GSM emerged from a cell-based mobile radio system at Bell Laboratories in the early 1970s.
   * GSM is the name of a standardization group established in 1982 to create a common European mobile telephone standard.
   * GSM is the most widely accepted standard in telecommunications and it is implemented globally.
   * GSM is a circuit-switched system that divides each 200 kHz channel into eight 25 kHz time-slots. GSM operates on the mobile communication bands 900 MHz and 1800 MHz in most parts of the world. In the US, GSM operates in the bands 850 MHz and 1900 MHz.
   * GSM owns a market share of more than 70 percent of the world's digital cellular subscribers.
   * GSM makes use of narrowband Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) technique for transmitting signals.
   * GSM was developed using digital technology. It has an ability to carry 64 kbps to 120 Mbps of data rates.
