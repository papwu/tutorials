We can broadly define an embedded system as a microcontroller-based, software-driven, reliable, real-time control system, designed to perform a specific task. It can be thought of as a computer hardware system having software embedded in it. An embedded system can be either an independent system or a part of a large system. In this tutorial, we will explain all the steps necessary to design an embedded system and use it.

# Audience
This tutorial has been designed to help the students of electronics learn the basic-to-advanced concepts of Embedded System and 8051 Microcontroller.

# Prerequisites
Before proceeding with this tutorial, you should have a good understanding of the concepts of basic electronics such as circuits, logic gates, etc.
