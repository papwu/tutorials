Etiquette is often mistaken for “mere table manners” but if we look at it from a broad prospective, the etiquettes a person practices tells us about his qualities and adequacies. A person with a good set of etiquette not only leaves a lasting impression, but also makes sure that he leads his life as an example to the ones in his family life and the workplace. Experts state that with the advent of culture, social etiquette underwent evolution along three main categories – Hygiene, Courtesy, and Cultural norms.
