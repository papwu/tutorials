A microprocessor is a controlling unit of a micro-computer, fabricated on a small chip capable of performing Arithmetic Logical Unit (ALU) operations and communicating with the other devices connected to it. In this tutorial, we will discuss the architecture, pin diagram and other key concepts of microprocessors.

# Audience
This tutorial is designed for all those readers pursing either Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science. It will help them understand the basic concepts related to Microprocessors.

# Prerequisites
In this tutorial, all the topics have been explained from elementary level. Therefore, a beginner can understand this tutorial very easily. However if you have a prior knowledge of computer architecture in general, then it will be quite easy to grasp the concepts explained here.
