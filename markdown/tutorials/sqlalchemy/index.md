SQLAlchemy is a popular SQL toolkit and **Object Relational Mapper**. It is written in **Python** and gives full power and flexibility of SQL to an application developer. It is an **open source** and **cross-platform software** released under MIT license. SQLAlchemy is famous for its object-relational mapper (ORM), using which classes can be mapped to the database, thereby allowing the object model and database schema to develop in a cleanly decoupled way from the beginning.

# Audience

# Prerequisites
