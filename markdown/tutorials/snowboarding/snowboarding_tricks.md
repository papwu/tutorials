## Straight Air Tricks
The straight air tricks are as follows −

   * **Ollie** − Ollie is considered as one of the basic tricks where the rider has to jump with the snowboard sticking to his/her shoes.

While on air, the player needs to use his front leg to guide the board or balance the board by pushing it using the front leg which will make it parallel to the ground and then land safely.
   * **Nollie** − The reverse to ollie is called nollie or nose ollie where the player has to use his front foot to pop the board while using his back foot to control and guide the board in air to land safely.
   * **Switch Ollie** − In case of switch ollie, the player has to perform an ollie while switching his position on the snowboard reverse his both feet positions.
   * **Fakie Ollie** − In case of fakie ollie, first the player has to perform ollie and while performing ollie, he has to switch his foot position. At the same time he/she has to spring off the board in direction of his switch.
   * **Air to Fakie** − This trick is mostly performed on a half-pipe surface where first the player moves on the half pipe surface and once he is in vertical position, he needs to re-enter the surface while performing a fakie without any switch.
