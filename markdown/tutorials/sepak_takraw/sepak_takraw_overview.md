Similar to volleyball, here also two teams of players try to control the ball by touching it using only their feet, chest, knee or head and try to kick the ball past the net to the opposition side. Failing to kicking the ball past the net results in a point to the opposition and the first team scoring the maximum point is declared winner.

## History of Sepak Takraw
Sepak Takraw was originated in Malaysia around 500 years ago. In the 15 century, it was mostly played by the royal court. Around 16 century, the game was spread across Indonesia, where people called it **Sepak Raga**. By 1940, the net version of the game was spread across Southeast Asia and formal rules and regulations were formed for the game.

During that period, the game used to be called **Sepak Raga Jaring**. Slowly the game spread across Southeast Asia and around 1950s, it was played in almost every school.
