Impromptu speaking is a mode of speech, generally modelled around a speech and debate event, where participants get a time-frame of eight minutes to deliver a speech on a given topic, with a characteristically short time of preparation, ranging between one and three minutes.

Primarily started as a technique to evaluate an individualâ€™s aptitude, it has since then moved on to be applied in day-to-day conversations, social meetings, official conferences, formal gatherings, etc.

The tutorial aims to train the learners the tips and techniques of speaking impromptu on stage. The strategies help the speaker to generate ideas in an extremely small frame of time and articulate the ideas well before an audience.
