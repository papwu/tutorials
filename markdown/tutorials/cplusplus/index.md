**C++** is a middle-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs. **C++** runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. This **C++** tutorial adopts a simple and practical approach to describe the concepts of **C++** for beginners to advanded software engineers.

## Why to Learn C++
**C++** is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning C++:

There are 1000s of good reasons to learn C++ Programming. But one thing for sure, to learn any programming language, not only C++, you just need to code, and code and finally code until you become expert.

## Hello World using C++
Just to give you a little excitement about **C++ programming**, I'm going to give you a small conventional C++ Hello World program, You can try it using Demo link

C++ is a super set of C programming with additional implementation of object-oriented concepts.

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// main() is where program execution begins.
int main() {
   cout << "Hello World"; // prints Hello World
   return 0;
}
```
There are many C++ compilers available which you can use to compile and run above mentioned program:

It is really impossible to give a complete list of all the available compilers. The C++ world is just too large and too much new is happening.

## Applications of C++ Programming
As mentioned before, C++ is one of the most widely used programming languages. It has it's presence in almost every area of software development. I'm going to list few of them here:

This list goes on, there are various areas where software developers are happily using C++ to provide great softwares. I highly recommend you to learn C++ and contribute great softwares to the community.

## Audience
This C++ tutorial has been prepared for the beginners to help them understand the basic to advanced concepts related to C++.

## Prerequisites
Before you start practicing with various types of examples given in this C++ tutorial,we are making an assumption that you are already aware of the basics of computer program and computer programming language.
