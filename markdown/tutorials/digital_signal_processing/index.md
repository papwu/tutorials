Digital Signal Processing is an important branch of Electronics and Telecommunication engineering that deals with the improvisation of reliability and accuracy of the digital communication by employing multiple techniques. This tutorial explains the basic concepts of digital signal processing in a simple and easy-to-understand manner.

# Audience
This tutorial is meant for the students of E&amp;TC, Electrical and Computer Science engineering. In addition, it should be useful for any enthusiastic reader who would like to understand more about various signals, systems, and the methods to process a digital signal.

# Prerequisites
Digital signal processing deals with the signal phenomenon. Along with it, in this tutorial, we have shown the filter design using the concept of DSP. This tutorial has a good balance between theory and mathematical rigor. Before proceeding with this tutorial, the readers are expected to have a basic understanding of discrete mathematical structures.
