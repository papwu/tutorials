Power View enables interactive data exploration, visualization, and presentation that encourages intuitive ad-hoc reporting. Large data sets can be analyzed on the fly using versatile visualizations in Power View. The data visualizations are dynamic, thus facilitating ease of presentation of the data with a single Power View report.

# Audience
This guide targets professionals with hands-on experience in Excel, to perform the highend data analysis and decision making in a matter of few minutes.

# Prerequisites
Power View is based on the Data Model in your workbook. Either you can start with a Data Model that is already available in Power Pivot or you can create a Data Model from Power View itself. In this tutorial, we assume that you are aware of the Data Model concepts in Power Pivot. Otherwise, we suggest you to go through our Excel Power Pivot tutorial first.
