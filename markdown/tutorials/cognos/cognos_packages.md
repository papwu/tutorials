# Cognos - Packages
In this chapter, we will discuss how to create a package using COGNOS.

In IBM Cognos, you can create packages for SAP BW or power cube data sources. Packages are available in the Public folder or in My folder as shown in the following screenshot.

Once a package is deployed, the default configuration is applied on the package. You can configure a package to use different settings or you can modify the settings of the existing package.

To configure a package, you should have administrator privilege.

Locate the package in the Public folder, click on More button under the Action tab as shown in the following screenshot.
