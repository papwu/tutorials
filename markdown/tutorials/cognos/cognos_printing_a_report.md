# Cognos - Printing a Report
You can also print a report to get a copy on paper. You can directly enter the Printer location while running the report or you can run the report in a PDF format and later you can take a printout of the report.

To take the print of the report directly, select the report and click on Run with options.

In the Delivery mode, select print the report and enter the location as shown in the following screenshot.
