## Sencha Touch ─ Benefits
Sencha Touch is the leading standard for business-grade web application development. It offers the tools necessary to build robust applications for most of the mobile devices providing a single platform for developing applications. Following are some of the benefits −

   * Provides a responsive touch feature, hence the user can easily navigate while using the mobile app.
   * Provides compatibility with all the latest versions of IOS, Android and Blackberry, and Windows.

## Sencha Touch ─ Limitations
Sencha Touch API doesn't have the following capability −

   * It is not good for hardcore graphics and animation apps such as for gaming apps.

## Sencha Touch ─ Tools
### Sencha SDK
This is Sencha development kit used to create a skeleton of the project. We use the command "sencha -sdk path/to/touch generate app appName" to create an app with the name given in the command.

When the app is created, you can see the following files in the app −

   * **app** − This folder contains model, view, controller and store files for the app.
   * **app.js** − This is the main JS file for your application. From this file, the Sencha code flow starts.
   * **app.json** − This is the configuration file for the app, all the configuration details presents here.
   * **index.html** − This is the main html file where we include the app.js and other Sencha related files.
   * **package.json** − This file has all the dependency and other information related to the app.
   * **resources** − This folder includes all the CSS files and images required for the application.

### Sencha CMD
Sencha CMD is a command line tool, which provides the features of Sencha Touch code minification, scaffolding, build generation, and other useful features for production purpose.

We use command "Sencha app build package" in the command prompt to build the application for this. Go to the app directory in the command prompt and type the above command. Once the build is successful, we will see the minified version of the application basically used for production purpose.
