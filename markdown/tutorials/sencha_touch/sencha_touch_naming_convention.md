# Sencha Touch - Naming Convention
**Naming convention** is a set of rules to be followed for identifiers. It makes the code easily readable and understandable for other programmers as well.

Naming convention in Sencha Touch follows the standard JavaScript convention, which is not mandatory but a good practice to follow. It should follow camel case syntax for naming the class, method, variable, and properties.

If the name is combined with two words, the second word will start with an uppercase letter always. For example, doLayout(), StudentForm, firstName, etc.
