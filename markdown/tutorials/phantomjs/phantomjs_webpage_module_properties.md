# PhantomJS - Webpage Module Properties
PhantomJS provides quite a lot of properties and methods to help us to interact with the contents inside a webpage.

The require("webpage").create() command creates a webpage object. We will use this object to manipulate the webpage with the help of properties and methods listed below.

```
var wpage = require("webpage").create();
```
The following table has the list of all the webpage properties that we are going to discuss.
