In this tutorial, we will discuss the important features of different types of sinusoidal oscillators, starting from their basic working principle to their circuit arrangement and behavior. If you are interested in learning the concepts of non-sinusoidal oscillators, then please refer to our tutorial on [Pulse Circuits](/pulse_circuits/index.htm) .

# Audience
This tutorial will be useful for all those readers who want to learn the basic principles of sinusoidal oscillators and oscillator circuits.

# Prerequisites
This tutorial is intended for beginners in the field of Electronics and communications. However, we assume that the readers have prior knowledge on the fundamental concepts of Basic Electronic Circuits and the behavior of different electronic components. For reference, the readers can browse through our [Electronic Circuits](/electronic_circuits/index.htm)  tutorial.
