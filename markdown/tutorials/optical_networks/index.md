Optical networks are telecommunications network of high capacity. They are based on optical technologies and components, and are used to route, groom, and restore wavelength levels and wavelength-based services. This tutorial is divided into distinct chapters, which explains the structural features of optical fibers and their connections in networks. The nature of optical networks along with the recent developments in the Optical and Networking systems using optical sources and devices is also dealt with.

# Audience
This tutorial is designed for learners who have interest in learning the networking concepts using optical sources. It will be useful for those having some idea regarding networking and optical sources.

# Prerequisites
Readers will benefit from this tutorial if they are aware of basic networking concepts. A fair idea on digital networking and digital communication systems will be a plus.
