Meteor is a full-stack JavaScript platform for building web and mobile apps. Meteor makes it easier to create real-time apps, since it alone offers a full ecosystem to work with, instead of combining couple of different tools and frameworks to get the same effect.

# Audience
This tutorial will be useful for any JavaScript developer who wants to learn Meteor framework. The tutorial is explained in a crisp manner with simple and easy-to-grasp code samples. Beginners will benefit the most from this tutorial. Readers can also use it as a reference while working with Meteor framework.

# Prerequisites
Meteor is a JavaScript framework, hence readers will need to have basic knowledge of JavaScript and HTML. They will also need to be familiar with NodeJS and MongoDB although it will also be easy to understand everything without previous knowledge.

If the readers have never used MongoDB, any knowledge about databases should suffice. Since Meteor is a full-stack framework, any previous experience in creating web or mobile apps will be helpful.
