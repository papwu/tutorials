CloudRail is an API integration solution that speeds up the process of integrating third-party APIs into an application and maintaining them. It does so by providing libraries for multiple platforms featuring abstraction layers that combine similar services behind a common interface.

# Audience
This tutorial targets software developers that want to learn how to lose less time on API integrations.

# Prerequisites
CloudRail provides libraries for Android, Java, Node.js and iOS (Objective-C and Swift). Basic knowledge of the respective platform is required to use the corresponding library.

You can quickly sign up for a free account at [https://developers.cloudrail.com](https://developers.cloudrail.com)  and get a license key which you will need to use the library.
