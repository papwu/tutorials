CherryPy allows developers to build web applications in much the same way they would build any other object-oriented Python program. This results in smaller source code developed in less time. It is being used in many production websites.

# Audience
This tutorial is primarily designed for developers who work on Python and are required to create portable database-driven web-based applications.

CherryPy provides the CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete) functionalities for applications and helps in managing the project from anywhere using the userâ€™s browser.

# Prerequisites
To draw benefits from this tutorial, you need to have a basic knowledge of Python programming. A good understanding of Model-View-Controller and Object-Oriented Programming is also equally important. If you are not well aware of these concepts, we suggest you go through our short tutorial on Python.
