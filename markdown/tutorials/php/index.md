The **PHP Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP)** is a programming language that allows web developers to create dynamic content that interacts with databases. PHP is basically used for developing web based software applications. This tutorial helps you to build your base with PHP.

## Why to Learn PHP?
**PHP** started out as a small open source project that evolved as more and more people found out how useful it was. Rasmus Lerdorf unleashed the first version of PHP way back in 1994.

**PHP** is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning PHP:

   * PHP is a recursive acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor".
   * PHP is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites.
   * It is integrated with a number of popular databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server.
   * PHP is pleasingly zippy in its execution, especially when compiled as an Apache module on the Unix side. The MySQL server, once started, executes even very complex queries with huge result sets in record-setting time.
   * PHP supports a large number of major protocols such as POP3, IMAP, and LDAP. PHP4 added support for Java and distributed object architectures (COM and CORBA), making n-tier development a possibility for the first time.
   * PHP is forgiving: PHP language tries to be as forgiving as possible.
   * PHP Syntax is C-Like.

## Characteristics of PHP
Five important characteristics make PHP's practical nature possible âˆ’

   * Simplicity

   * Using PHP, you can restrict users to access some pages of your website.
   * It can encrypt data.
