WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is the new standard for 3D graphics on the Web, designed for rendering 2D graphics and interactive 3D graphics. This tutorial starts with a basic introduction to WebGL, OpenGL, and the Canvas element of HTML-5, followed by a sample application. This tutorial contains dedicated chapters for all the steps required to write a basic WebGL application. It also contains chapters that explain how to use WebGL for affine transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling.

# Audience
This tutorial will be extremely useful for all those readers who want to learn the basics of WebGL programming.

# Prerequisites
It is an elementary tutorial and one can easily understand the concepts explained here with a basic knowledge of JavaScript or HTML-5 programming. However, it will help if you have some prior exposure to OpenGL language and matrix operation related to 3D graphics.
