Sockets are communication points on the same or different computers to exchange data. Sockets are supported by Unix, Windows, Mac, and many other operating systems. The tutorial provides a strong foundation by covering basic topics such as network addresses, host names, architecture, ports and services before moving into network address functions and explaining how to write client/server codes using sockets.

# Audience
This tutorial has been designed for everyone interested in learning the data exchange features of Unix Sockets.

# Prerequisites
Learning Sockets is not at all a difficult task. We assume that you are well versed with the basic concepts of C programming.
