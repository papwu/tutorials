An Algorithm is a sequence of steps to solve a problem. Design and Analysis of Algorithm is very important for designing algorithm to solve different types of problems in the branch of computer science and information technology. This tutorial introduces the fundamental concepts of Designing Strategies, Complexity analysis of Algorithms, followed by problems on Graph Theory and Sorting methods. This tutorial also includes the basic concepts on Complexity theory.

# Audience
This tutorial has been designed for students pursuing a degree in any computer science, engineering, and/or information technology related fields. It attempts to help students to grasp the essential concepts involved in algorithm design.

# Prerequisites
The readers should have basic knowledge of programming and mathematics. The readers should know data structure very well. Moreover, it is preferred if the readers have basic understanding of Formal Language and Automata Theory.
