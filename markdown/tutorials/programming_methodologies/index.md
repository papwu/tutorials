When programs are developed to solve real-life problems like inventory management, payroll processing, student admissions, examination result processing, etc., they tend to be huge and complex. Programming Methodology is the approach to analyzing such complex problems by planning the software development and controlling the development process. In this tutorial, we will cover the top-down approach to programming, also called **modular programming**. We will also learn about requirement gathering, problem definition and identifying unique solution to the given problems. In addition, we will throw light on the best practices for code optimization.

# Audience
This tutorial is designed for anyone who wants to learn about programming methodologies and how to use them to design solutions to a given problem.

# Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites for this tutorial except a desire to learn how to write good programs. However, it would definitely help if the readers have some prior experience in writing codes in any programming language.
