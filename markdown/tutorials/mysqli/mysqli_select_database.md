         $dbuser = 'root';
         $dbpass = '<Password Here>';
         $conn = mysqli_connect($dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass);
   
         if(! $conn ) {
            echo 'Connected failure<br>';
         }
         echo 'Connected successfully<br>';
         mysqli_select_db( 'TUTORIALS' );
   
         //Write some code here
