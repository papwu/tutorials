Canoeing is a sport in which the racers use a canoe and paddle it using a single blade. The boat used in this sport is pointed at both ends and one or more paddlers propel it in water. This tutorial has been designed to provide a basic knowledge about Canoeing. Canoeing should not be confused with rowing as the type of boats used in rowing are different from canoeing.
