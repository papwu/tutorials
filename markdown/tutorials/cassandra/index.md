Cassandra is a distributed database from Apache that is highly scalable and designed to manage very large amounts of structured data. It provides high availability with no single point of failure.

The tutorial starts off with a basic introduction of Cassandra followed by its architecture, installation, and important classes and interfaces. Thereafter, it proceeds to cover how to perform operations such as create, alter, update, and delete on keyspaces, tables, and indexes using CQLSH as well as Java API. The tutorial also has dedicated chapters to explain the data types and collections available in CQL and how to make use of user-defined data types.

# Audience
This tutorial will be extremely useful for software professionals in particular who aspire to learn the ropes of Cassandra and implement it in practice.

# Prerequisites
It is an elementary tutorial and you can easily understand the concepts explained here with a basic knowledge of Java programming. However, it will help if you have some prior exposure to database concepts and any of the Linux flavors.
