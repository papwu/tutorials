The Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) is a set of APIs to implement concepts of modern cryptography such as digital signatures, message digests, and certificates. This specification helps developers integrate security in their applications.

# Audience
This tutorial has been prepared for beginners to make them understand the basics of JCA. All the examples are given using the Java programming language therefore, a basic idea on Java programming language is required.

# Prerequisites
For this tutorial, it is assumed that the readers have a prior knowledge of Java programming language.
