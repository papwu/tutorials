This tutorial offers a brief introduction to the fundamentals of graph theory. Written in a reader-friendly style, it covers the types of graphs, their properties, trees, graph traversability, and the concepts of coverings, coloring, and matching.

# Audience
This tutorial has been designed for students who want to learn the basics of Graph Theory. Graph Theory has a wide range of applications in engineering and hence, this tutorial will be quite useful for readers who are into Language Processing or Computer Networks, physical sciences and numerous other fields.

# Prerequisites
Before you start with this tutorial, you need to know elementary number theory and basic set operations in Mathematics. It is mandatory to have a basic knowledge of Computer Science as well.
