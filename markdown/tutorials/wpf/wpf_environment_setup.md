# WPF - Environment Setup
Microsoft provides two important tools for WPF application development.

   * Visual Studio
   * Expression Blend

Both the tools can create WPF projects, but the fact is that Visual Studio is used more by developers, while Blend is used more often by designers. For this tutorial, we will mostly be using Visual Studio.

## Installation
Microsoft provides a free version of Visual Studio which can be downloaded from [VisualStudio](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx) .

Download the files and follow the steps given below to set up WPF application development environment on your system.

   * After the download is complete, run the **installer**. The following dialog will be displayed.
