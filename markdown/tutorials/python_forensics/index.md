Python has built-in capabilities to support digital investigation and protect the integrity of evidence during an investigation. In this tutorial, we will explain the fundamental concepts of applying Python in computational (digital) forensics that includes extracting evidence, collecting basic data, and encryption of passwords as required.

# Audience
This tutorial is meant for all those readers who seek to increase their understanding in digital or computational forensics through the use of Python. It will help you understand how to integrate Python in computational forensics.

# Prerequisites
Before starting with this tutorial, it is important that you understand the basic concepts of computational forensics. And, it will definitely help if you have prior exposure to Python.
