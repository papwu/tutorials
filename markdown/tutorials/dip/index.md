# Audience
This tutorial gives you the knowledge of widely used methods and procedures for interpreting digital images for image enhancement and restoration and performing operations on images such as (blurring , zooming , sharpening , edge detection , e.t.c). It also focuses on the understanding of how the human vision works. How do human eye visualize so many things , and how do brain interpret those images? The tutorial also covers some of the important concepts of signals and systems such as (Sampling , Quantization , Convolution , Frequency domain analysis e.t.c).

# Prerequisites
## Signals and systems
Since DIP is a subfield of signals and systems , so it would be good if you already have some knowledge about signals and systems , but it is not necessary. But you must have some basic concepts of digital electronics.

## Calculus and probability
Basic understanding of calculus , probability and differential equations is also required for better understanding.

## Basic programming skills
Other than this, it requires some of the basic programming skills on any of the popular languages such as C++ , Java , or MATLAB.
