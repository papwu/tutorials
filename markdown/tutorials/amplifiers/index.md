An electronic signal contains some information which cannot be utilized if doesnâ€™t have proper strength. The process of increasing the signal strength is called as **Amplification**. Almost all electronic equipment must include some means for amplifying the signals. We find the use of amplifiers in medical devices, scientific equipment, automation, military tools, communication devices, and even in household equipment. In this tutorial, we will discuss all the important concepts from the introduction of transistors along with the amplifier action of transistor. In addition, we will cover all the topics related to all the major types of **transistor amplifiers** in detail.

# Audience
This tutorial will suit all beginners who want to learn the fundamental concepts of transistors and transistor amplifier circuits.

# Prerequisites
Though this tutorial is intended for beginners in the field of Electronics and Communications, we expect the readers to have some prior knowledge regarding the functioning of different electronic components. Therefore, we suggest that you first go through our tutorial on [Basic Electronics.](/basic_electronics/index.htm)
