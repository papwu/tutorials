**Cordova** is a platform that is used for building mobile apps using HTML, CSS and JS. We can think of Cordova as a container for connecting our web app with native mobile functionalities. Web applications cannot use native mobile functionalities by default. This is where Cordova comes into picture. It offers a bridge for connection between web app and mobile device. By using Cordova, we can make hybrid mobile apps that can use camera, geolocation, file system and other native mobile functions.
