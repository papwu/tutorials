# Apache Camel Tutorial
Apache Camel is an open source framework that provides rule-based routing and mediation engine. Apache Camel essentially provides an implementation of various EIPs. It makes integration easier by providing connectivity to a very large variety of transports and APIs. For example, you can easily route JMS to JSON, JSON to JMS, HTTP to JMS, FTP to JMS, even HTTP to HTTP, and connectivity to Microservices. You simply need to provide appropriate endpoints at both ends. Camel is extensible and thus in future more endpoints can be added easily to the framework.
