# SharePoint - Capabilities
In this chapter, we will be covering the default set of capabilities (or features) built into SharePoint that enables you to take advantage of the platform without doing any development.

   * You can use or extend these core capabilities when building your Apps. Microsoft has historically referred to these capabilities as workloads.
   * These workloads provide a way to talk about the different capabilities of SharePoint coming together. You should see these workloads as representing not only a core set of related applications but also as opportunities for your application development.

Following are the workloads, which were added in SharePoint 2010 −

   * **Sites** − Representing the different types of sites available for use and the features within these sites.

   * **Content** − Representing core enterprise content management features.
   * **Search** − Representing the search-driven features.
