Computer Logical Organization refers to the level of abstraction above the digital logic level, but below the operating system level. At this level, the major components are functional units or subsystems that correspond to specific pieces of hardware built from the lower level building blocks.

This tutorial gives a complete understanding on Computer Logical Organization starting from basic computer overview till its advanced architecture.

# Audience
This reference has been prepared for the students pursing either Bachelors or Masters in Computer Science to help them understand the basic-to-advanced concepts related to Computer Logical Organization.

# Prerequisites
Before you start proceeding with this tutorial, I'm making an assumption that you are already aware of basic computer concepts like what is keyboard, mouse, monitor, input, output, primary memory, secondary memory, etc. If you are not well aware of these concepts, then I will suggest you to go through our short tutorial on [Computer Fundamentals](/computer_fundamentals/index.htm) .
