OpenCV is a cross-platform library using which we can develop real-time **computer vision applications**. It mainly focuses on image processing, video capture and analysis including features like face detection and object detection. In this tutorial, we explain how you can use OpenCV in your applications.

# Audience
This tutorial has been prepared for beginners to make them understand the basics of OpenCV library. We have used the Java programming language in all the examples, therefore you should have a basic exposure to Java in order to benefit from this tutorial.

# Prerequisites
For this tutorial, it is assumed that the readers have a prior knowledge of Java programming language. In some of the programs of this tutorial, we have used JavaFX for GUI purpose. So, it is recommended that you go through our JavaFX tutorial before proceeding further [javafx](/javafx/index.htm) .
