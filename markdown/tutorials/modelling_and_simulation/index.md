In Modelling &amp; Simulation, Modelling is the process of representing a model which includes its construction and working. This model is similar to a real system, which helps the analyst predict the effect of changes to the system. Simulation of a system is the operation of a model in terms of time or space, which helps analyze the performance of an existing or a proposed system. In this tutorial, we will discuss the concept and classification of Modelling &amp; Simulation, their architecture, application areas, and other key ideas.

# Audience
This tutorial is designed for all those readers pursing either Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science. It will help them understand the basic concepts related to Modelling &amp; Simulation.

# Prerequisites
In this tutorial, all the topics have been explained at the elementary level. Therefore, a beginner can easily understand this tutorial. However, if readers have a prior knowledge of computer architecture in general, it will be quite easy to grasp the concepts explained here.
