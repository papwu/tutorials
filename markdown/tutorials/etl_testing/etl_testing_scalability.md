# ETL Testing – Scalability
The goal of ETL testing is to achieve credible data. Data credibility can be attained by making the testing cycle more effective.

A comprehensive test strategy is the setting up of an effective test cycle. The testing strategy should cover test planning for each stage of ETL process, every time the data moves and state the responsibilities of each stakeholder, e.g., business analysts, infrastructure team, QA team, DBA’s, Developers and Business Users.

To ensure testing readiness from all aspects, the key areas a test strategy should focus on are −

   * Scope of testing − Describe testing techniques and types to be used.
   * Setting up the test environment.
   * Test data availability − It is recommended to have production like data covering all/critical business requirement.
   * Data quality and performance acceptance criteria.
