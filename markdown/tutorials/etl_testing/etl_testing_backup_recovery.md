# ETL Testing â€“ Backup Recovery
Backup recovery for a system is planned to ensure that system is restored as soon as possible from a failure and operations are resumed as early as possible without losing any important data.

ETL Backup recovery testing is used to ensure that the Data Warehouse system recovers successfully from hardware, software, or from a network failure with losing any data.

A proper backup plan must be prepared to ensure maximum system availability. Backup systems should be able to restore with ease and should take over the failed system without any data loss.

ETL Testing Backup recovery involves exposing the application or the DW system to extreme conditions for any hardware component, software crash, etc. The next step is to ensure that recovery process is initiated, system verification is done, and data recovery is achieved.
