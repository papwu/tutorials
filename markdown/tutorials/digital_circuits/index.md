This tutorial is meant to provide the readers to know how to analyze and implement the combinational circuits and sequential circuits. Based on the requirement, we can use either combinational circuit or sequential circuit or combination of both. After completing this tutorial, you will be able to learn the type of digital circuit, which is suitable for specific application.

# Audience
This tutorial is meant for all the readers who are aspiring to learn the concepts of digital circuits. Digital circuits contain a set of Logic gates and these can be operated with binary values, 0 and 1.

# Prerequisites
A basic idea regarding the initial concepts of Digital Electronics is enough to understand the topics covered in this tutorial.
