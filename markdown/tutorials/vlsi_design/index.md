Over the past several years, Silicon CMOS technology has become the dominant fabrication process for relatively high performance and cost effective VLSI circuits. The revolutionary nature of these developments is understood by the rapid growth in which the number of transistors integrated on circuit on single chip. In this tutorial we are providing concept of MOS integrated circuits and coding of VHDL and Verilog language.

# Audience
This reference has been prepared for the students who want to know about the VLSI Technology. The students will be able to know about the VHDL and Verilog program coding.

# Prerequisites
Before you start proceeding with this tutorial, we make an assumption that you are already aware of the basic concepts of Digital Electronics.
