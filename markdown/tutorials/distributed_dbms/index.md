Distributed Database Management System (DDBMS) is a type of DBMS which manages a number of databases hoisted at diversified locations and interconnected through a computer network. It provides mechanisms so that the distribution remains oblivious to the users, who perceive the database as a single database. This tutorial discusses the important theories of distributed database systems. A number of illustrations and examples have been provided to aid the students to grasp the intricate concepts of DDBMS.

# Audience
This tutorial has been prepared for students pursuing either a master’s degree or a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, particularly if they have opted for distributed systems or distributed database systems as a subject.

# Prerequisites
This tutorial is an advanced topic that focuses of a type of database system. Consequently, it requires students to have a reasonably good knowledge on the elementary concepts of DBMS. Besides, an understanding of SQL will be an added advantage.
