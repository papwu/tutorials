TensorFlow is an open source machine learning framework for all developers. It is used for implementing machine learning and deep learning applications. To develop and research on fascinating ideas on artificial intelligence, Google team created TensorFlow. TensorFlow is designed in Python programming language, hence it is considered an easy to understand framework.

# Audience
This tutorial has been prepared for python developers who focus on research and development with various machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The aim of this tutorial is to describe all TensorFlow objects and methods.

# Prerequisites
Before proceeding with this tutorial, you need to have a basic knowledge of any Python programming language. Knowledge of artificial intelligence concepts will be a plus point.
