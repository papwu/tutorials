Let us now consider the following important features of TensorFlow −

   * It includes a feature of that defines, optimizes and calculates mathematical expressions easily with the help of multi-dimensional arrays called tensors.
   * It includes a programming support of deep neural networks and machine learning techniques.
   * It includes a high scalable feature of computation with various data sets.
   * TensorFlow uses GPU computing, automating management. It also includes a unique feature of optimization of same memory and the data used.

## Why is TensorFlow So Popular?
TensorFlow is well-documented and includes plenty of machine learning libraries. It offers a few important functionalities and methods for the same.

TensorFlow is also called a “Google” product. It includes a variety of machine learning and deep learning algorithms. TensorFlow can train and run deep neural networks for handwritten digit classification, image recognition, word embedding and creation of various sequence models.
