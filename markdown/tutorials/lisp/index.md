Lisp is the second-oldest high-level programming language after Fortran and has changed a great deal since its early days, and a number of dialects have existed over its history. Today, the most widely known general-purpose Lisp dialects are Common Lisp and Scheme.

Lisp was invented by John McCarthy in 1958 while he was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
